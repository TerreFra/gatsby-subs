You were saying that you can grant me any wish.”<br />\n“Yes, exactly. You know, there’s plenty of people who fail to grasp the situation, given how sudden and unrealistic reincarnation is…”<br />\nAfter a sigh of relief, she smiled again and asked:<br />\n“So, what do you wish for?”<br />\n“Please, enslave me.”<br />\n“As. I. Said. You can ask for anything! Why do you keep saying that?!”<br />\nAnnoyed, the Goddess raised her voice and pointed her finger at him.<br />\nHe was very composed.<br />\nMoving her gaze from his lips, she looked into his eyes brimming with confidence.<br />\nShe crossed both arms and legs admiring his astonishing beauty from the height of her throne.<br />\nIt was clear that he firmly believed in himself.<br />\n“You’ve asked me if I had a wish. So hurry and enslave me now, please.”<br />\n“No, wait a moment. There are times when I’d like to have some company, but I’d never gotten as far as wanting a slave…”<br />\n“I don’t want to be a slave of some God like you. I’m telling you to reincarnate me bound by chains, without properties or social status.”<br />\n“You what? Isn’t this going too much toward bondage?!”<br />\n“Don’t get the wrong impression. I meant that I want people to look down on me. Fortune, status, authority… It would be pointless if I can’t start from zero.”<br />\nThe Goddess was at a loss for words and squatted desperately. Since she started her work, she helped many people, but no one asked to be enslaved before.<br />\nThen, an idea suddenly popped into her head.<br />\n“Oh, I see! You want to start as a slave and become the strongest with your hidden powers, right?! I get it, I get it. Now tell me which ability…”<br />\n“Try to give me anything special and next time we see each other I’m going to beat you to death.”<br />\n“Why?! I just want the best for you as a Goddess!”<br />\nHer eyes welled with tears as she didn’t know how to deal with that man anymore.<br />\nHe snorted, bored at that reaction.<br />\n“If you help me in any way, my regret will never fade. Let me reincarnate with my memories and appearance, please.”<br />\n“Eh…? Well, you’d keep your memories anyway… I could copy your body and make sure it grows accordingly, but…”<br />\n“But? Is there any problem?”<br />\n“Well… to put it simply, you’d die. You’re going in a world where magic and magical creatures exist. If you don’t have any ability, I can’t help but think that you want to die…”<br />\n“It’s fine. I have a regret despite the fact I was surrounded by wealth.”<br />\nThe Goddess tilted her head, intrigued by the man smiling brightly.<br />\n“Err… By the way, what do you regret so much? You keep saying you want to start from zero, but wouldn’t it better to have a handy power?”<br />\n“What? You’re a Goddess, you should know this.”<br />\n“Well, people depict Gods as high-ranked entities… but let’s say that actually we have a sort of people management role…”<br />\n“I couldn’t care less of your conditions, but thank you anyway. Keep up the hard work.”<br />\nMore than showing sympathy for the depressed Goddess, the man started explaining.<br />\n“My life was way too easy.”<br />\nThe Goddess couldn’t grasp the meaning of his words, hence she frowned and asked –<br />\n“You mean that… you regret the fact that you never had problems?”<br />\nAs she looked at him suspiciously, the man started to tell his story…<br />\n“You know, I was good at everything. Once I decided to do something, it always turned out just like I wanted. To the point that I never regretted anything.”<br />\nThose words sounded sarcastic, but his expression was dead serious.<br />\nAs the man remembered his past, a gloomy shadow dropped over his eyes.<br />\n“But… before my death I realized that… I was ‘regretting’ it. The truth is, I haven’t achieved anything with my abilities alone. My circumstances simply let me be a step up other people.”<br />\nHe looked down, then wore his usual smile.<br />\n“That’s why I want to reincarnate in the most cruel environment. In order to know how far I can go on my own… Are you listening?”<br />\nAs he played his monologue, the Goddess stared at him with a freezing gaze.<br />\n“Yes, of course I am. So, it is just the whim of a spoiled child. Holy me, people’s bragging is really boring. It was so boring I almost thought I was listening to my superior&#8217;s old stories.”<br />\n“The world of gods is also tough, huh? In that case, please, let me reincarnate and sink in this insane hard-mode.”<br />\n“I’d do it even if you hadn’t asked. Luckily, I found a world that fits your preferences. Go die in a hole or by the roadside as soon as you set foot in there, thanks.”<br />\n“Can you refrain from wishing my death? It’s not cool. Anyhow, as long as I have my hope, everything will be all right.”<br />\nShe sighed as opposed to the man’s dazzling smile.<br />\nAfter a few moments, under his feet shone a faint blue light that enveloped him.<br />\nHe started to vanish like he was being sucked by it.<br />\nThe Goddess, who had been pouting for a while now, remembered that she had a duty to fulfill, so she cleared her throat and bid him farewell with a tender smile.<br />\n“Well then, I wish you a new life with no more regrets!”<br />\nHe simply returned a smile.<br />\nAfter that… the man who regretted not having regrets started his new life.</p>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Introduction","slug":"newgame-introduction","categories":[{"slug":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-introduction","category":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}}}
