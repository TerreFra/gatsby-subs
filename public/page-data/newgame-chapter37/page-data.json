They should have been able to crush anything standing in their way, and yet&#8230; they had lost.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">And to make things worse, he was defeated the moment he entered the arena to settle the score. The lowest human on the planet, some guy that couldn&#8217;t even use magic, had him in the palm of his hand from the start.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"it-IT\">No&#8230; I didn&#8217;t lose&#8230;!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Even though Kiad had lost the match, his defeat was never officially declared. But even just trying to find any sort of justification for himself was pissing him off.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">What he needed to do was sending that damn slave merchant straight to hell. And if he didn&#8217;t&#8230; he was afraid that something within him might break.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">He tried to drive that feeling away and headed to the royal castle&#8217;s laboratory, when, at the end of the corridor, he saw a little girl walking towards him—her silver hair tied up into twintails.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">&#8230;Are you awake, Lord Kiad?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The tone of her voice was as flat as ever.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">&#8230;Lize, I was looking for you.

I even blocked the magic that allowed you to hear whatever I could.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She lowered her gaze while facing the man.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">I will not help you in your experiments anymore.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The man&#8217;s expression twisted unsightly at her words.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">YOU UNGRATEFUL LITTLE SHIT! DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU&#8217;RE SAYING?!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Smacked by his roar, her body jolted and froze.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">WHO PICKED YOU UP AND LET YOU STUDY WHEN YOUR FATHER DIED?!

Due to that, a constant sense of guilt tormented her and gnawed at her heart.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Despite being a child, she knew it very well—what she was doing was absolutely wrong&#8230; but she was forced to do it. Locking her heart away was her only way to keep it together—not to make her sanity crumble to pieces.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">I&#8217;ve had enough&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to hurt any more people with my work!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Her jumpy voice was clear despite her shaky legs.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She had finally squeezed out of herself the words she most feared to say in front of Kiad.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Is that all, Lise Crest?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The low, heavy sound of his words was stained with murderous intent.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">My pet dog still bit me even while chained and with its tight collar on, huh?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">As rage started to blind him, he slowly closed their distance.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">You don&#8217;t get it at all&#8230; You can&#8217;t even dream to be free.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">His gaze seemed to look at some unnecessary piece of trash as he towered over her.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">LET ME BRAND ON YOUR BODY WHAT BITING ME AND THE FORTESEA ENTAILS!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">He charged his fist to vent all of his rage on Lise when a sash of light sprouted from the darkness and coiled around his arm. Many others bound his body until he found himself completely blocked, and then he snapped, unable to contain his rage anymore.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">I KEEP GETTING THWARTED EVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME! I&#8217;M A FORTESEA, AND NOTHING CAN STOP ME FROM DOING THE FUCK I WAAANT!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">His lunatic scream roared in the hallway as his eyes became bloodshot.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Then, the clacking sound of approaching footsteps started to reverberate over his voice—a self-confident grin filled the calmly approaching man&#8217;s face.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">&#8230;Can I ask you not to lay your filthy hands on my best article?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Hearing that voice, Kiad twisted his neck to watch behind him: there stood Elsa, whose Binding Magic was restraining him, and Takumi.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Slave merchant&#8230;!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Yes, it&#8217;s me.

I DON&#8217;T GIVE A SHIT IF YOU&#8217;RE AN OVERLORD, I&#8217;LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Neither will I forgive you, Kiad.

WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MEANING OF THIS?!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Takumi&#8217;s grin broadened when Kiad&#8217;s glare shifted from Elsa to Lise, who was still standing in front of him.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Lise Crest, we&#8217;ve come to retrieve you as this slave merchant&#8217;s belonging.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Takumi took a document out of his breast pocket and waved it on Kiad&#8217;s face.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">That brat asked me for a huge-ass sum of money a few days ago, but since she couldn&#8217;t pay it back entirely, I made her become my slave.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">SPARE ME YOUR BULLSHIT!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">This isn&#8217;t bullshit. She couldn&#8217;t pay me back for the super expensive ingredients we put in her apple pie, which would be around&#8230; like, a thousand holy silver coins.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Takumi was obviously joking, but the document he was holding in his hand was absolutely authentic, and the name of Lise Crest was scrupulously written on it.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">They must have found a way to keep in touch with her without him knowing, that&#8217;s why she holed herself up in the laboratory until today.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Still, the only contact she should&#8217;ve had with people was with the maids that brought her food and checked her body up to see if anything was off&#8230; which means that they could&#8217;ve used only one way.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">I-It can&#8217;t be&#8230; I crushed it, there was nothing—”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">That&#8217;s mean. Did you really crush my leader&#8217;s pie? She put her soul into it&#8230; although it was only a snack for Lise.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Takumi gasped as he waved the document in front of him.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Did you forget that Suzuran is a company of the slums? We&#8217;re the lowest craftiest scum around&#8230; and our way of doing really do us justice. We know a lot of ways to contraband stuff, and it&#8217;s very easy when we speak in coded language between comrades.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>Cooked sweets </i></span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">meant that they were going to smuggle something, </span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>the basket</i></span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> was the way they were going to perform it, </span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>putting the sweets in the basket</i></span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> meant that the contract was somewhere in there, and </span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>doing it for Lise </i></span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">meant that she was involved with the contract.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Our former leader loved to come up with this kind of tricks.

There wasn&#8217;t anything like that in Richtert&#8230; it could&#8217;ve even been a variation of some type of language.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">When I studied magic, law formulas were the thing that most interested me—I don&#8217;t have magic power within me, so I find magic and magic tools useless, but law formulas make use of other people&#8217;s magic power.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">With a smile plastered on his face, Takumi waved the paper in front of Kiad.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Law formulas are very interesting&#8230; they can active so long as the used language and symbols make sense. They could work even with something that isn&#8217;t part of this world.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">That law formula was written with the language he had learned in his previous world, so it was something that shouldn&#8217;t have existed in their current world.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">That&#8217;s why it might bring unexpected results.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Kiad, tell me&#8230; what happens to a human when they get stripped of their magic power?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Slowly, Takumi brought the paper closer to his target, who was shaking his head violently.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">That&#8217;s impossible! Humans can&#8217;t rule over magic!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The next moment, his instinct shrilled to get away from there, but he couldn&#8217;t move.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Fall to hell.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Mouthing sharp words, Takumi pushed the document on Kiad&#8217;s chest, and the paper squirmed as it was alive, assaulting the man&#8217;s body.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">STOP IT! I&#8217;M PART OF THE VALIANT FORTESEA, THE STRONGEST—”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">He felt like his inner self was getting teared to pieces by an intruder. His dignity, his pride, his power; everything that was part of him was getting destroyed.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Takumi looked at him coldly.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">&#8230;Is that so? I didn&#8217;t fight you, so I can&#8217;t tell you are.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">A few seconds later, the light bindings coiled around his body had vanished, and he was left staring at the air with empty eyes, shivering and clattering his teeth.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Why&#8230; Why is my power&#8230; what I inherited from the Fortesea&#8230;”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">He was powerless—his heart had been torn to pieces and his condition was now a living hell. Takumi, after observing him for a brief moment, lost any interest in him and faced Elsa.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">I&#8217;m done here. I&#8217;ll bring Lise to her buyer and leave the rest up to you.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Okay, no problem. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have anything to do with Kiad like that.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Her expression stiffened as she glanced at the man who was hanging his head in a trance.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Takumi&#8230; I trust you because we somewhat collaborate, but&#8230; tell me again, what are you? What are you aiming for?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She squinted her green eyes ever so slightly.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">You siblings look alike in the most strange places&#8230;” </span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Remembering that not that long ago even Lux asked him the same thing, Takumi smiled happily.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">I only want to see how far my abilities can bring me. I&#8217;m aiming for&#8230; let&#8217;s say something big, like world peace or world domination.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Tch, I knew it. You&#8217;re the kind of guy who&#8217;d answer like that.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Thank you for understanding. Rest assured that I won&#8217;t do anything bad, anyway.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">I&#8217;m not worried about that&#8230; you&#8217;re the ‘Soft-hearted slave merchant’, after all.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">He faced a shrugging Elsa with a bitter smile, then turned to approach Lise.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Howdy~! You really tried your best there.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">&#8230;Yes, I tried my best&#8230; and I have a favor to ask you.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">A favor? What is it?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">&#8230;My legs are shaking so much I cannot move.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Reaching her limit, her legs caved in, and she composedly fell on her bottom.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Jeez&#8230; I&#8217;ll piggyback you, get on.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Stop treating me like a child! No, I never said I was not getting on!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">With her cheeks flushing red, she climbed on Takumi&#8217;s back, who had bent over, then he started walking to the garden where the buyer was waiting.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">For a short while they were silent as Takumi&#8217;s clacking footsteps resounded in the stone-paved corridors.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Thank you, Takumi.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Lise&#8217;s few words sounded like a distant whisper.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">I could find the courage to say it only thanks to you. That I have had enough. That I do not want my work to hurt people&#8230;”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">You said it because you wanted to. Even if you didn&#8217;t tell him a thing, I still would&#8217;ve brought you to our Queen.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Even so, you never turned your back to yourself like I did, and you successfully defeated strong magicians like Fortesea&#8217;s&#8230; if you did not show me that, I would have kept those words to myself alone.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She talked slowly as she clung to his shoulders.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">I kept pretending not to see that what I was doing was hurting people&#8230; That is why I had to act the opposite of what I wanted.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Her words were a firm declaration—I can&#8217;t forget about those I hurt with my actions, and I can&#8217;t forget about trying to find a justification about it.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She let out a soft yelp when he cocked his head to his side and hit her nose with the back of his head.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Ih huhss&#8230;”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">I mean&#8230; children shouldn&#8217;t think about stuff that complex. Just face sincerely what you really want to do.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">What I really want to do&#8230;?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Be glad of what you accomplished. People always see the bad part in everything, as if it&#8217;s the only part that leaves an impact&#8230; but you accomplished way more than that.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">He started to speak about her accomplishments with a warm laughter.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">The law formulas you invented can be used in a lot of different ways. The binding magic we&#8217;ve just seen is just one of them.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">&#8230;Right. Lux asked me to create a law formula that helped guards to seize people without hurting them. It&#8217;s useful to arrest criminals or to quell riots.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">You live in this part of the city so you probably don&#8217;t know it, but those magic tools are used quite a lot down in the slums. That place is a mess and there&#8217;s very poor public order, you know?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Since the slums were filled with violence and criminals, the guards&#8217; equipment was provided with defensive barriers and seizing magic tools just like Elsa&#8217;s. They were used frequently.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">With them, even a simple quarrel can end with people being unscathed, and there isn&#8217;t much risks for guards to face criminals, since they have their defensive barriers. Also, Elsa told me they can be used in many other ways.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">He took a brief pause before resuming his talk.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Let&#8217;s take Binding Magic for example. When it rains very hard, the water flowing to the slums becomes very muddy and its current becomes fast and powerful like a rushing stream, so it isn&#8217;t rare for kids to get hit by a wave or something and fall into water, where they usually drown. Still, some times they&#8217;ve been saved thanks to those magic tools.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Saving them has been very hard, but it&#8217;s been possible only thanks to Binding Magic.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">It&#8217;s even been used for rebuilding a destroyed church. Bringing logs of wood that high requires quite a lot of attention, but thanks to Binding Magic, they could speed up the process and once more provide a shelter for those who&#8217;ve lost a place to sleep.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">As he spoke, he felt Lise trembling, but he pretended not to notice and kept talking.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">That&#8217;s the same for those defensive barriers. Before, when something caved in, people had to pulverize the rubble with magic, but that could hurt the survivors who were buried under them. Now the soldiers can just jump on people, saving them right away as the barrier activates. Yeah, those who decide to do that have balls of steel, but it&#8217;s all thanks to magic tools if they can do stuff like this. They&#8217;re all happy to have them.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">He could hear Lise trying to stifle her sobbing.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">I bet you thought only about the bad things you&#8217;ve done, but many other people are grateful to you, as they could save someone or be saved by someone with the tools you&#8217;ve created.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Lise let out a soft lament as her tears started to stain Takumi&#8217;s overcoat.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">That&#8217;s why you shouldn&#8217;t deny everything you&#8217;ve done. Even though you blame yourself for what went wrong, you should be proud of your achievements.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Unable to hold back anymore, she started to sob out loud.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/V6XVNZ1.png\" /></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">You did great by yourself so far.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She pressed her face on his back as her little body trembled. Her tears streamed from her eyes as if to wash away her sense of guilt—a reaction fitting a child her age.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Takumi didn&#8217;t speak another word, and after buying a little time with a couple of detours, he headed to the garden where Eluria was waiting them.</span></p>\n\n\n\n</p>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 37","slug":"newgame-chapter37"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter37","category":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}}}
