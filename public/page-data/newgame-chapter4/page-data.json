Part 4</h3>\n<p><span lang=\"en-US\">Let’s introduce Listina, the capital.<br />\nRichtert Castle was visible over Listina’s roofs, and the town’s structure is divided into upper, middle and lower part.<br />\nBoth the fortress and the town were surrounded by high walls.<br />\nA huge lake was located south from the capital, a rocky mountain range spreaded north, and plains stretched out as far as the eye could see from east to ovest.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">It looked like Mother Nature blessed <span lang=\"en-US\">the city</span> with all of her elements.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">The </span><span lang=\"en-US\">Meld Mountain Range didn’t just block the cold winter’s winds, but it also served as a natural barrier against potential invaders.<br />\n</span>Verne Lake was famous due to a certain characteristic.<br />\nIt was a brackish lake. Its water flowed directly into the sea, which water defiled the lake’s.<br />\nThanks to that feature, ships had access to the lake from the sea without troubles.<br />\nIn order to save time avoiding the hardships of land transportation, the city developed particularly in maritime trading.<br />\n<span lang=\"en-US\">Also, the Eltern Plains were devoid of potholes and such hindrances, so even the nearby kingdoms used them as trade routes.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Since Listina has an ideal geographical location and it’s famous as a trading metropolis, a wide variety of traveling merchants visits it to expand their business.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-US\">Before letting them in the city, their merchandise must be examined.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-US\">That’s why each of the city gates is protected by guards stationed not too far from their barracks.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-US\">They have to keep their eyes open to make sure that nobody breaks the law.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-US\">One of them was half asleep, and let out a big yawn as he watched the sun rising.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Aaah… it’s finally morning. If<span lang=\"en-US\"> only </span>the others <span lang=\"en-US\">would hurry up and</span> <span lang=\"en-US\">take </span>over, we <span lang=\"en-US\">could</span> go back home right away.”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I agree, but if you were in their shoes, would you do that as soon as you wake up?”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Well… no, I would have a big breakfast first.”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“That’s the same for them. I understand that you’re sleepy, but be patient.”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Yes sir. Try to keep me awake talking about something interesting, only to kill some time.”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Guess I can’t help it… Let’s talk about the ‘ghost wagon,’ then.”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Do you mean the wagon that was spotted in the middle of the night driven by a corpse?”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“…Let me start, at least.”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A guy told me about the ‘ghost ship’ when I was guarding the port.”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I see. Probably you two didn’t have anything to do and he struck up a conversation just like you did.”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">As they entertained themselves with that trivial chit-chat, both were smiling at each other.<br />\nThey were so sleepy that they could have fallen asleep<span lang=\"en-US\"> while</span> chewing food or drinking some wine.<br />\nThe only way to come to their senses would have been a real scare.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">When they heard the neigh of a horse in the distance, they looked in that direction.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I guess we have some work to do. We’re lucky we have to examine a wagon right now, huh?”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">You c</span><span lang=\"en-US\">an say that, but we have to work to live, right?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">They exchanged a wry smile.<br />\nSeeing the wagon getting closer, they glanced at each other.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Isn’t that a bit weird?”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">It looks like a wagon </span><span lang=\"en-US\">used for transporting goods, but I don’t see the usual cloth… No, wait, I can see it fluttering in the wind. Maybe it was attacked by bandits.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">In that case, why </span><span lang=\"en-US\">would it come here at this time?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">The sun cast the wagon’s shadows towards the city, so they could only wait for it to get closer to get a better look.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Anyway, what was that about the ghost wagon?”</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s said that a wagon that carried slave children was attacked by bandits who killed each of them, so they became ghosts out of resentment and now their corpses roam this land.”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Oh my… If my eyes aren’t deceiving me, the coachman of that wagon looks like a child</span><span lang=\"en-US\">…”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">The closer the wagon got, the smaller the coachman looked compared to an adult.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“…Just know that if that’s the real deal, I won’t move from here.”</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Don’t worry. If it really is, to hell with work. Let’s run like crazy.”</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">They held their breath waiting nervously for the wagon’s arrival… and it finally started to slow down, until it stopped near them.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">The coachman really was a child, and he was wearing a kind smile as he waved to them.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Hey! Being on duty this early in the morning </span><span lang=\"en-US\">is really admirable!”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hearing his friendly greeting made the guards feel relieved.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Well, it’s our duty. But… this wagon isn’t yours, is it?”</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“No, it isn’t. We were attacked by bandits on the way here, so I thought to return this to its rightful owner.”</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">The guards looked puzzled.<br />\n<span lang=\"en-US\">The present coachman wore a black collar… a slave collar.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-US\">They started wondering why he didn’t flee, since the bandits might have killed his sellers.<br />\nThe child’s reasoning was nonsense.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“…I have to check the wagon.”</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Feel free to. But please, don’t wake anyone up. They’re all tired.”</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Keeping an eye on the child, one of the guards looked in the wagon. There were nine children, a werebeast, an elf… and two men. Everyone was lying on the ground.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Oh, there are some adults. I’d like to talk to…”</p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">When he tried to </span><span lang=\"en-US\">wake up one of them, he noticed that the body was way too cold.<br />\n</span>His bloody head rolled floppily, and stopped staring lifelessly at the guard.<br />\n<span lang=\"en-US\">The child, still acting as the coachman outside, never stopped smiling.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Oops, I forgot to say that some</span><span lang=\"en-US\"> of them are dead tired. I wanted to bring them to their families before they rotted, so… can you help me getting in touch with the owner of this wagon, please?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">The miserable scream of the guard resounded outside the city walls.</p>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 4","slug":"newgame-chapter4"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter4","category":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}}}
