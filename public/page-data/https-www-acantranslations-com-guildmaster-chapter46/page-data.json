I suggested Zect to mainly accept the dungeon-exploring requests, and he looked fine with that, so I put him into the ‘scouting unit’, while his sister became a trainee in the ‘intelligence unit’.\nThe young girl wanted to work as an employer for our bar too, so Verlaine took care of her preparation. Mizuha could rarely leave her house before she joined our guild, so she was pretty overjoyed to work outside. I&#8217;m sure she didn&#8217;t want to feel caged anymore.\n“You handle customers and regulars very well, Mizuha, and all of them appreciate you so far. You are doing very good, keep up the hard work. Remember to speak properly to our guests when you talk to them, okay?”\n“Yep, ma&#8217;am! As yer wish! I&#8217;ll do me best!”\nVerlaine praised Mizuha as they opened the bar, and the next moment a couple of guests entered the room.\nOne of them was a girl with long black hair tied up with a red ribbon. She wore a dark brown overcoat covering her blouse and skirt. Evidently, she was trying to keep a low profile.\nThe other one was a tall brawny middle-aged man with silver hair tied like a warrior. His blue eyes gave off a light so sharp that Mizuha, seeing him, jumped a little in surprise. He wore an almost black overcoat as well, but his frame was so big it was impossible for him to keep a low profile.\nThey were two Guild Masters: Sherion Heartis from Red Gemini and Leonid Ballanche from Black Leo.\n“Welcome~! I&#8217;ll take you to your seats!”\n“Hey, Dick! I didn&#8217;t know you had a daughter! When did it happen? Going for the fox tribe is quite the smart move.”\nLeonid had a very bright personality that didn&#8217;t fit his frame at all. Also, how could Mizuha be my daughter? She could&#8217;ve been my sister if she had to be blood-related to me&#8230; but that thought made me sorry for Zect.\n“Sir Dick&#8217;s daughter&#8230;? Verlaine, wotcher think about it?”\n“If it would imply that I helped him having you, it would be totally fine with me.”\n“That&#8217;s not fine at all. Leonid, we last meet half a year ago. No matter how fast demi-humans grow, she couldn&#8217;t have grown this much in such a short time, so she can&#8217;t be my daughter. Also, stop calling me by name when you&#8217;re here, please.”\n“Oh, please, at least be grateful I put on this cloak. It&#8217;s so hot outside I thought I&#8217;d be baked by the time I entered your bar.”\nSherry—it was Sherion&#8217;s pet name—started to fan herself with her overcoat. She was quite weak against heat, and the weather today perfectly fitted the criteria of the sixth month&#8217;s standard day.\n“Oh, don&#8217;t worry, Dick. I only met her outside.”\n“I&#8217;m quite younger than you, I doubt anyone would think we&#8217;re dating or something.”\n“Hahaha! Why don&#8217;t we have a date where you pretend to be my granddaughter, then?”\nLeonid was the oldest among the Guild Masters. He was old enough to have a grandchild. His adventurer score lowered over time and it was now settled at 54820 points, but he was still a veteran lancer in Black Leo.\nSherry was a red mage. She used my same kind of abilities, but her magic was different.\nIt was very versatile: she could use it offensively, defensively, and for healing. Her magic worked especially well against men, who she could bind to her will. I was immune to it, but the average guy couldn&#8217;t stand a chance against her. Her adventurer score was 33927, making her a S rank adventurer.\nThe only condition to become a Guild Master was to be at least a S rank adventurer, but given that they couldn&#8217;t take many missions themselves, a guild couldn&#8217;t be judged by the strength of their Guild Master alone. Both Red Gemini and Black Leo were not to be underestimated.\n“Mizuha, show them to their private room, please.”\n“Yes, Ma&#8217;am! Please, follow me.”\nAfter glancing at me, the two Guild Masters followed our new waitress. Even during lunchtime, when a few people started to enter the place to grab some food, no one noticed their presence.\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">◆◇◆</p>\n\n\nFunnily enough, Sherry liked sweet sherries<a class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" href=\"#sdfootnote1sym\" name=\"sdfootnote1anc\"><sup>1</sup></a>. To quench her thirst, I recommended her a cocktail made with her favorite sherry, some lemon juice, and a tiny bit of gin and sake along with some sugar cane syrup.\nLeonid asked for a jug of brown ale and I ordered the same. I didn&#8217;t call them over to drink together, but we were still in a bar, so why not take the chance to drink something?\n“First, let&#8217;s toast to our prosperous guilds! Cheers!”\nLeonid rose his jug in high spirits and started to chug his ale down. Sherry sipped her drink the next moment and let out a soft ‘nice’.\n“Great! The ale in this bar tastes very good!”\n“So, Dick, why did you want to talk to us?”\nSherry asked with a deadpan expression on her face. Now that she had took off her overcoat, she was leaning over from her torso up, letting her huge breasts rest on the table. Maybe she didn&#8217;t notice or she wasn&#8217;t paying attention to it, and Leonid, who sat in front of her, didn&#8217;t care in the slightest, so I kept it to myself and let the conversation go on.\n“Sherry, what kind of requests does White Aries hand you? I&#8217;m not asking for any secret detail, I&#8217;d just like to know what you can tell me.”\n“Actually&#8230; I was waiting to get a better picture of the situation before talking to you. but I guess you noticed it already, huh?”\n“What are you talking about? Is White Aries up to something? Those guys are no good&#8230;!”\nWhile Leonid started to get irritated, Mizuha entered the room with another jug of ale for him. Verlaine must have guessed he was going to flare up soon and prepared him a refill in advance.\n“Mister, I brought you another jug.”\n“Oh, thank you, I appreciate it. Here, have a tip. Go buy something you like with it.”\n“Wot?! A-Are yer right sure I can &#8216;ave it?! I-I mean, a-are you sure I can have it?”\n“Of course, feel free to keep it. None of my chips has been wasted so far.”\nMizuha bowed politely before accepting, then left the room. Leonid never had bronze coins with him. He only paid at least with silver ones and never accepted any rest, so he often finished the money he brought with him.\nSherry waited a few moments before resuming our conversation. I guessed it was going to be something quite serious if not even my guild members had to hear it.\n“Lately, we received a job that looked like an experiment.”\n“An experiment&#8230;?”\n“I think it&#8217;s about some magic item that has yet to be released on the market. It isn&#8217;t very clear on the request form, but that&#8217;s what I understood from what I read.”\nThe discussion turned for the worse in a moment. My trust for White Aries was starting to crumble to pieces.\nOne could own magic items, but they were absolutely illegal depending on their effects. Without a certification that stated a certain object or item could be used in the capital, nothing could be legally used or owned, and White Aries was now making their affiliated guilds experiment with some kind of unknown magic tool.\n“Can you tell me more about it?”\n“I refused to accept the request, so I don&#8217;t know the details and I didn&#8217;t see it myself. I think it&#8217;s something to control people, judging by the stuff written on the request form.”\n“A mind-controlling magic item?! Like, an hypnotizing something?! What the hell is wrong with them?! It&#8217;s obviously bullshit!”\nLeonid flared up again. Talking about White Aries must&#8217;ve put him in a bad mood.\nSherry&#8217;s words made me connect the dots&#8230; my guess was right.\nWhite Aries was probably behind the demi-human traffic too. The item Sherry had mentioned could be the same contraption that was used to control Mizuha and the other demi-humans.\nIf that kind of item was improved and could extend its control over humans as well&#8230; the consequences would&#8217;ve been catastrophic.\n“Did someone accept it, in the end?”\n“All of this sounded wrong to me, and I couldn&#8217;t get it out of my mind, so I asked all the other guilds. They told me they had refused, but Purple Scorpio never answered.”\n“Lady Sherry, are you alright? Probing into their private affairs could mark you as their target.”\n“So be it. If they want to dirt their hands, I&#8217;m ready to do the same. No matter how bothersome it will be.”\nI knew she was a prideful Guild Master ready for anything, but she still looked slightly sleep-deprived. She gulped down some of her drink before facing me with her tired gaze.\n“Dealing with White Aries is hard. The request form stated that those who accepted were going to work hand in hand with them and that no information had to be leaked. That&#8217;s probably how things are currently going in Purple Scorpio.”\n“So now that you asked around, Lady Sherry, it&#8217;s like you&#8217;ve stepped into their territory?”\n“I believe so. White Aries&#8217; strongest adventurers are SS rank. If both of them were to raid our guild at the same time, they&#8217;ll play havoc with us&#8230;”\nZect would&#8217;ve never bothered to do that despite being as strong as them, but White Aries&#8217; heads would use any means to make the other guilds behave.\nSherry&#8217;s lips trembled slightly. She was living in fear of that possibility.\n“I should&#8217;ve noticed their actions sooner. Sorry I&#8217;ve been this slow, Sherry.”\n“No problem&#8230; I cannot disobey their orders anyway, since we&#8217;re affiliated to them. But I must admit they did a lot for us, although things have changed now.”\n“Maybe something happened to them, otherwise their Guild Master shouldn&#8217;t have reasons to do this&#8230; or was it just a change of mind? Maybe talking to them could help us getting the picture better. What&#8217;s your opinion, Dick?”\n“Maybe it would be better if we keep our doubts a secret for now. It would be annoying if they dispatch too many people to keep an eye on us all.”\nStill, given Sherry&#8217;s circumstances, we had to make her feel safer&#8230; or at least better.\nI could read on Leonid&#8217;s face that he was thinking the same, and after gulping down what was left of his second jug, he folded his arms.\n“As an adventurer guild, White Aries said they want to keep the order in the capital&#8230; but now I believe there&#8217;s something more in their words, or they just distorted them.”\n“I don&#8217;t know&#8230; maybe I&#8217;m just reading too much into it&#8230; By the way, they&#8217;ve left a copy of the request in our guild. Dick, could you come to my guild to take a look at it?”\nI&#8217;m sure she had already made it read to her intelligence team, but I really appreciated the honesty she was showing me.\nIf I had to go to Red Gemini, I could just pretend not to know anything about this. Maybe keeping this a secret even to the members of my guild and moving on my own would&#8217;ve been better.\n“Sure, you can count on me.”\nFor the first time since we sat around the table, she looked relieved. I thought she was hiding to her guild members that she was actually being crushed by stress, and seeing her bring a hand to her chest and sigh only confirmed my guess. This meant that she accepted to come here to look for help.\nA Guild Master bears the burden of all their guild members&#8217;s life. Sherry was a strong woman, that&#8217;s why she never let her distress out in the open.\nShe tried to reach out to her glass again, but her hands were shaking. As soon as I noticed it, I grabbed them and cast Mind cure.\nThe effects kicked in right away, and she lowered her gaze sneering at herself.\n“I&#8217;m pathetic. I shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of something like this.”\n“There&#8217;s nothing wrong in being afraid of something, Sherry. We can trust Dick in times like this. He would never leave a beauty like you alone.”\n“Actually, I help everyone, no matter the beauty. I&#8217;m sure if I had any problem, you would help me too. Anyway, do you want some food?”\nSherry looked surprised by the sudden question, and her stomach grumbled. That&#8217;s the answer I wanted to hear.\n“I&#8230; I forgot to have my breakfast&#8230; How embarrassing.”\n“That&#8217;s the proof you&#8217;re still alive! Don&#8217;t be embarrassed! I&#8217;d like some meat, anyway! Dick, go cook something for us!”\n“Don&#8217;t worry, we hired an expert cook. You won&#8217;t be disappointed.”\nVerlaine was great at cooking, but we also had other cooks. A few minutes after we ordered, a nice smell of food started to waft from the kitchen. I ordered some roasted walnuts as well, given how talkative Sherry&#8217;s tummy was.\nLeonid asked for a third jug of beer, gave another tip to Mizuha with a huge smile on his face and started to drink in high spirits.\nLuckily, I was right about White Aries. Thank goodness I didn&#8217;t wait to ask about them.\nI still didn&#8217;t know if Sherry&#8217;s guild was their accomplice, though&#8230; I had to lay my hands on White Aries&#8217; unknown magic tool to figure it out.\nWho built it? Where was it now? When did they want to use it? What did it do, specifically? Why creating it, in the first place?\nCould my information network help me figure out everything about this matter?\nThe time had come—the investigation started.\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<a class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" href=\"#sdfootnote1sym\" name=\"sdfootnote1anc\"></a>\n\n\n<div id=\"sdfootnote1\">\n\n\n<p class=\"sdfootnote\"><a class=\"sdfootnotesym\" href=\"#sdfootnote1anc\" name=\"sdfootnote1sym\">1</a> He means the wine <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry</a> Also, I asked a friend of mine who works as a bartender some help with the drink Dick prepares her, and he ended up insulting the author and suggesting me to change the drink because the thing described in the original doesn&#8217;t work.
