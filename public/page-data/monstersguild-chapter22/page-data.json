They were accustomed to this, but the monsters were not few.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">We got a lot of them. Let&#8217;s take the raw materials and get back to the city.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Okay.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">They were adventurers, people who travel from city to city while undertaking dangerous tasks every day.\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Death might wait behind every corner for them, but there were times where their work wasn&#8217;t exactly life-threatening.\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lately, the number of youngsters who wanted to go down that road was decreasing.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">There&#8217;s really a lot of monsters in this forest. Isn&#8217;t that tamer&#8217;s dragon thinning out their number?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Groaned the warrior while harvesting their loot.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Well, the breeding season will start soon, you know?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">So we&#8217;re going to have more work, huh?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The warrior looked toward the Forest of Monsters as he thought about what they were going to experience this year.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"CENTER\">◆</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">That said, I&#8217;m a knight formally assigned to this role, so I&#8217;ll keep living here.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Said Lety. A month already passed since Merck returned back.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Congratulations, I guess?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Yes, thank you.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><i>Aren’t they basically demoting her?</i></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Thought Raiz, but he couldn’t say it after seeing her so happy.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">So, what will your job be? There are already guards, so you can’t steal theirs.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He already knew what she had to do, but asked anyway to avoid misunderstandings.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Apparently, I&#8217;ll be part of the garrison in charge of protecting the citizens from the creatures of the Forest of Monsters, but the truth is that I&#8217;ll act as your bodyguard. You have a lot of strong monsters, but they occasionally aren&#8217;t around because someone requests for their help. In those cases, I&#8217;ll use my authority to protect you!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">She put a lot of emphasis on the last part, but her duty wasn&#8217;t different from what Raiz and Merck agreed on.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><i>Essentially, she is not a guard but has the authority to be one? I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have to worry since I have already neutralized a special unit, though&#8230;</i></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">And&#8230; where are your comrades?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">If there were any, they should have at least shown their faces to the man they were going to protect.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Nowhere. I&#8217;m the only knight in Dekuch!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Thinking about it rationally, her work was really absurd, but that made things easier for Raiz, who didn&#8217;t pry further in the matter.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><i>Well, dispatching her alone means reducing the costs of my protection to the bare minimum, but there’re still people who are keeping an eye on me. Seems like some of them are preparing for something, but so far, no one noticed that each cat of the city is Cat sith&#8217;s underling.</i></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Cat siths were also called the ‘Kings of cats’.\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">They couldn&#8217;t only share information at a long distance, but also subjugate any normal cat.\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">That ability was another reason why Raiz was an exemplary soldier, since he could gather a lot of information.</span> <span lang=\"en-GB\">It even made him know about Dekuch&#8217;s crisis.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Sorry, is Raiz there?!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">A loud, girlish voice rang from outside the hut.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Yes, I&#8217;m coming!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He had to cut the conversation with Lety short and started to walk to what would soon become a full-fledged entrance, since someone was probably waiting outside.\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">His guess was soon revealed correct when, reaching the hut&#8217;s ‘provisional door’, he saw a serious-looking girl in her twenties.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz Tamer, right? My name is Ino, from the Adventurer&#8217;s union.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">She bowed lightly to him as a greeting.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><i>She looks so rigid&#8230;</i></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I&#8217;m here for a request.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">What is it?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">She stared right into his eyes, her firm gaze showed her determination.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It had to be an important request.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Can you help us with the Forest of Monsters? The breeding season has started.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a class=\"sdfootnotesym\" href=\"#sdfootnote1anc\" name=\"sdfootnote1sym\">1</a> The original says “<span style=\"font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode;\">にじり寄る食欲” </span>but we couldn&#8217;t figure out how appetite fitted this chapter, so we changed it for now.
