Hope I can get back on track soon.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The volunteer soldiers and the monsters</h3>\n<p>The flying unit approached the incoming wave while clutching the bags with their claws.<br />\n“Guuuys! When we get over them, rip your bags!”<br />\nHarpy, their leader, started ordering the griffins and hippogriffs lined up behind her.<br />\nWhen they got close enough, blacksmiths and carpenters&#8217; lumps of discarded metal fell from the cuts on the bags. Sword and axes didn&#8217;t deal much damage when threw, but metal falling from a vertiginous height became a deadly weapon, considering the acceleration and impact.<br />\nCountless monsters let out cries of pain under them. It was a simple, one-sided and nightmarish assault that could reach even the rear-guard of the enemy lines.<br />\nBut this time, the enemy was a large number of starving beasts, none of which intelligent enough to escape after suffering from something that devastating.<br />\nMany monsters instantly died, but those who survived maintained their march while stepping over their comrades’ corpses and dividing into groups.<br />\n“Now it&#8217;s our turn!”<br />\nA huge butterfly, Papillon, the leader of the second flying unit, spoke from behind Harpy.<br />\nThis unit&#8217;s duty was to attack the monsters who tried to jump over the corpses to avoid the piles of metal and corpses.<br />\nSlowing the wave down was one of Raiz and the others&#8217; tactics. Decimating the front guard while the rear one was falling behind gave them enough time to regroup and focus on fewer targets.<br />\n“They&#8217;re starting to split! Third unit, it&#8217;s time to destroy them!”<br />\nThe volunteer soldiers fired their arrows at once, and despite many of them missed their target, the outcome wasn’t bad.<br />\nThat was possible only thanks to the hordes&#8217; sheer number, given that aiming wasn&#8217;t necessary to hit.<br />\nStill, the monsters never stopped advancing.<br />\nIf things kept going that way, it wouldn&#8217;t have taken them much to reach the walls&#8230;<br />\nThen, rustling sounds and thuds arose from their front line, who disappeared into dark holes on the ground: the traps. Wandworm dug them all around the city.<br />\nThey were seven meters deep, three meters large, and their walls were hard to climb.<br />\n“Good! Close combat unit, finish those in the traps!”<br />\nThe soldier immediately followed the commander&#8217;s order, and they started to attack the monsters with special spears that were longer than the average ones.<br />\nThose who didn&#8217;t meet Lety&#8217;s standard were assigned to that role.<br />\nThe fallen monsters couldn&#8217;t attack back or dodge the spear strikes, considering the small space they were confined in. That way, even amateurs could still one-sidedly kill their targets.<br />\nMeanwhile, the experienced soldiers and Raiz&#8217;s monsters had started to move&#8230;</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter26/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/monstersguild/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter28/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n","title":"Monsters&#039; Guild &#8211; Chapter 27","slug":"monstersguild-chapter27","categories":[{"slug":"welcome-to-the-monsters-guild"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monstersguild-chapter27","category":"welcome-to-the-monsters-guild"}}}
