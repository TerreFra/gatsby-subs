Guess I never really introduced myself so far. I'm Zahj, AcanTranslation's only translator. I'm going to write a brief summary of my 2019 before the chapter to make everyone know why AcanTranslation's releases have been so sporadic this year. <strong>Feel free to skip this, but please, read the &#8220;tl note&#8221;!</strong>\nWe&#8217;ve been on a hiatus for some months because my former editor had a lot of exams at his university and a lot of stuff to do at work, so he couldn&#8217;t dedicate any time to these projects (and he still doesn&#8217;t). I&#8217;m talking about December 2018 &#8211; January 2019. In that period, I was so tired of translating I just had to take some time for me&#8230; and so I did. Unluckily, I&#8217;m the kind of guy who forgets or doesn&#8217;t want to rest, so it isn&#8217;t uncommon for me to be saturated (which we can roughly translate as &#8220;I&#8217;m dumb, please be patient&#8221;).\nAfter taking an entire month for me my batteries were finally replenished, so I decided to wait a bit longer for my editor and improve my language skills on some other sectors of the translation world like mangas, comics, anime and stuff, but&#8230; well, dumbness kicked in and I ended up taking too many projects in my hands, so now I&#8217;m completely saturated with work.\nAfter another month, I understood that I couldn&#8217;t keep waiting forever and I started to search for a new editor (who is the one currently helping me with New Game and Dick), and once I found one, it took her around two or three months to read through all the past chapters to get to the point I was at. She is very busy with her life and university, so it couldn&#8217;t be helped.\nThe beneficial part of all of this is that I got to be an &#8220;official translator&#8221; for some projects by working my ass off (I&#8217;ll link them in the next chapters of these series when they&#8217;ll be ready) and I could meet and collaborate with a ton of adorable people. I also gained a bit of attention from the people I admired (yes guys, some senpais noticed me), so I&#8217;m very happy about the results I achieved&#8230; but on the other hand, it was all at the expenses of AcanTranslation&#8217;s projects, since I don&#8217;t have as much time as I had in 2017 or 2018 to work on them.\nI&#8217;m currently working on a total of 10 projects divided into comics (I&#8217;m getting paid for some of them), animes (not in English) and light novels (Dick and New Game are included in them), and well, I was a bit too late to notice that&#8217;s a bit too much for a puny human like me to handle, so now I&#8217;m focusing on the paid projects and trying to complete the ones that are almost finished to get a bit more time to work on these novels and some other projects.\n<strong>Be reassured</strong>: I have absolutely no intention to drop Dick or New Game. I won&#8217;t drop them even if someone &#8220;sniped&#8221; them, because I like these projects so far and I want to keep working on them.\nI&#8217;ll try to release at least a chapter of them each month, but I&#8217;m sure sometimes I&#8217;ll fail to. Don&#8217;t hate me for that.\nThis will probably be the last post of the year, as I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have time to work on New Game soon.\nLet me thank you all for your patience and for following these series despite the long waiting time.\nOh, and thank you for pointing out that the website was dead for a few hours! I forgot to keep the dominion alive, but now it&#8217;s all fine and dandy!\nWish you a merry Christmas and a fun New Year&#8217;s!\nTL note: I kind of mistranslated the way Mizuha talks, but I don&#8217;t really know how to convey it for now. She kind of alternates formal speaking and colloquial Kansai Dialect, but I didn&#8217;t know how to convey it in a proper English accent, so for now I changed her way of talking. Feel free to suggest changes about it, and thank you in advance if you do!\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The blue fox tribe siblings and their homeland&#8217;s fruit</h3>\n\n\nBlue Sagittarius helped Garamdoor with demi-humans trafficking.\nI believed what Mizuha said, but I only had circumstantial evidences, so I couldn&#8217;t prove it yet. Also, even if I reported Garamdoor, we wouldn&#8217;t be able to demonstrate Blue Sagittarius&#8217; involvement.\nI was racking my brain about how to find a crucial proof&#8230; when Sakuya entered the shop from the backdoor. What a perfect timing, she had probably waited the end of our conversation.\n“Master, the demi-humans prisoned in Garamdoor&#8217;s attic has been moved to another place, but I already figured their new location out.”\n“Great job as always, Sakuya. So, where are they now?”\n“Look at this map. This inn in the 11th street looks like many others, but I received eyewitness reports of Garamdoor&#8217;s people bringing huge luggages into it.\nZect and Mizuha&#8217;s expressions darkened at her words.\nThe young fox was clearly mad and she surely wasn&#8217;t afraid of fighting for her own kind. Her power wasn&#8217;t something to be underestimated, as Aileen had almost went all out in their showdown.\n“Let us help too. I&#8217;d love to quench my revenge. But more than that, I wanna rescue those prisoners.”\n“&#8230;Let me join too. I don&#8217;t want to kill anyone in the capital and I promise I won&#8217;t ruin the reputation of your guild.”\nAileen almost had to face Zect and Mizuha, who were two SS rank adventurers, ‘seriously’, so those siblings alone were more than enough to handle this mission&#8230; but three men could be better than two.\n“If you allow me, I will be their guide.”\n“Sure thing, Sakuya, please do. Sorry for always bothering you.”\n“No bother. I was going to rescue those demi-humans anyway.”\nSakuya&#8217;s will was clear. The dedication in her investigation brought her to find the demi-humans&#8217; new prison. If she went all out, she could&#8217;ve rescued them even by herself.\n“Rigel, Lia, McKinley, well done. Your job is over, so feel free to go home and relax.”\n“Yay! We&#8217;d like to help too, but it would be bad if we attracted attention for being too many on the move, so I&#8217;ll just go home.”\n“Let us know if we can help. We&#8217;ll make sure to be ready for anything.”\nAfter that, Rigel and McKinley left the room and headed to the guild&#8217;s dormitory.\n“Mister Guild Master, I&#8217;d love to help too&#8230; as a fellow demi-human, I want to rescue them.”\n“Are you sure? You just got back from a mission, aren&#8217;t you tired? Let me heal you and rest for a bit.”\n“Mhh&#8230; T-Thank you, but you don&#8217;t need to worry. I trust my stamina.”\nI cast Healing Light on her to help her recover&#8230; and while I was on it, I did the same on everyone else. It didn&#8217;t even cost me much magical power.\n“Master, I was not expecting to be healed&#8230; your consideration warms my heart.”\n“Even priests hesitate to use Healing Magic due to its huge cost of magical power&#8230; I really admire your kindness, Sir Guild Master.”\n“&#8230;What on earth is your main job?”\n“Brother, what a silly question. Is he not a Guild Master?”\n“It should be written on my guild tag, but unluckily I don&#8217;t have it with me right now.”\nI deceived them and recalled what was really written on my guild tag&#8230;\nOh boy, they&#8217;d have seen I&#8217;m a SSS rank adventurer with ‘Demon Lord Slayer’ as my job&#8230;! All my efforts to be unnoticed would&#8217;ve gone to waste!\nOn the other hand, I was starting to take into consideration the possibility of acting in the frontline instead of pulling the strings from the shadows&#8230;\nWait, that wasn&#8217;t the time to think about it. The next moment, I noticed Aileen eyeing Mizuha.\n“Oh, right, Mizuha! You&#8217;re only wearing that overcoat, aren&#8217;t you cold? Do you want some warm clothes? I live nearby, I can get some for you.”\n“I have another small maid dress like this in my room. It is on the second floor. Let me know if I should take it for you.”\n“Are you sure? Then I&#8217;d&#8230; urr&#8230; I wanna&#8230;”\nIt was a hard choice: a onepiece dress with a long deep slit like one of Aileen&#8217;s martial art&#8217;s uniforms or Verlaine&#8217;s maid dress?\n“&#8230;Since you work here I&#8217;m sure you need as many change of clothing as you can, so I&#8217;d go for Aileen&#8217;s, if I can.”\n“Sure thing~! Wait a few minutes, I&#8217;ll get back in a flash!”\nAileen left the room and headed to her house while Verlaine brought a hand to her cheek.\n“Usually, our customers enter the bar expecting a maid-dressed girl to serve them&#8230; losing against Lady Aileen is slightly vexing&#8230;”\n“By the way, Mizuha, if I consider you as one of our employees, do you mind if I pair you up with Zect?”\n“Guild Master, quit the formalities when you speak of me. I&#8217;d be your subordinate just like my sister, so you don&#8217;t have to be this mindful. Also, I&#8217;ve yet to start working for you.”\n“Oh, okay. Got it.”\n“Forgive my brother, he&#8217;s adamant on some topics. He&#8217;s always been the thickhead he looks like.”\n“&#8230;Sorry.”\nZect&#8217;s reply was curt, but I could tell he wasn&#8217;t really angry. Mizuha knew it, that&#8217;s why she tried to laugh the matter off with that joke.\n“&#8230;Now, would you like to take a bath before changing your clothes? Or do you prefer to wait until you return home?”\n“Ah&#8230; s-sorry, I couldn&#8217;t bathe for some time. I-I must&#8230; s-smell like&#8230;!”\n“You don&#8217;t smell. My overcoat is odorless.”\n“Whatcha say?! I&#8217;m wearin&#8217; it &#8216;cause I can&#8217;t just walk &#8216;round naked! It&#8217;s self-control! Do ya have any idea when I last took a bath?!”\nIt&#8217;s common for adventurer to camp outside, so they slowly grow accustomated to their own smell, but sometimes they get reminded of the importance of bathing.\nWhen I was still an adventurer, there were times I didn&#8217;t bath for days, but whenever I got back home, my sisters forced me to take one. And well, now I got why. Bathing is a good thing, and even though the tub was a luxury, I would&#8217;ve used it every day if I could.\n“Verlaine, can you prepare a bath for her? She&#8217;d probably like to change  clothes after it.”\n“Can I?! Boy, It&#8217;s been so long since my last one I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m gonna take it now&#8230;! This guild&#8217;s adorbs! Don&#8217;t cha think too, Brother?”\n“I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re better, but stop playing around. I can feel shame too.”\n“Please, turn a blind eye to her tomboyish behavior. She is still your adorable little sister.”\n“Verlaine, how kind of you&#8230;! Ma&#8217;am, I like you! Can we live together?! My brother can live by himself, I&#8217;ll bother him every now and then!”\n“Why are you&#8230; well, fine. Do as you please&#8230;”\nZect&#8217;s baffled expression was so precious I was about to forget he was a SS rank adventurer&#8230; but I had heard of his achievements in Blue Sagittarius, and they were all surely proof of his strength.\nRescuing the demi-humans from their prison wouldn&#8217;t be hard for him. If he paired with Sakuya, there wouldn&#8217;t be anything to do for me and I could leasurely drink all day in the bar.\n“&#8230;Master, are you going to employ Mizuha as our waitress? She probably has the right attitude to join the intelligence department.”\n“Oh, you think so too, Sakuya? These siblings look great, don&#8217;t you think?”\n“Yes. What about measuring their adventurer score?”\nMizuha&#8217;s score probably rivalled Sakuya&#8217;s, or it was even higher than hers.\nThe blue fox tribe girl was stronger in her beast form, so now she should&#8217;ve more or less matched a S rank adventurer.\nSince I broke our guild&#8217;s measurement instrument, I had to buy a new one&#8230; but maybe it was better to bring the siblings with me and let a specialist measure their score.\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">◆◇◆</p>\n\n\nThe basement of the inn that Sakuya had pointed out really turned to be the prison of Garamdoor&#8217;s articles. It was guarded by some members of Blue Sagittarius, but they were all B or C rank adventurers, so Zect&#8217;s party easily defeated them all without being noticed.\nWithin the prison were a wolf girl and a racoon guy wearing the collar that forced them into their beast form. They were caged in different jails.\nOnce the collar was on, their consciousness dulled and they grew wild like beasts, so different species couldn&#8217;t be together, as they risked to attack each other. Some of the people ‘questioned’ by Zect&#8217;s party said that even beast-tamers gave up handling them.\nThe inquiring party welled with rage when they heard that, but none of them vented it on the inn&#8217;s owner or the Blue Saggittarius&#8217; members guarding the prison.\nNow that they had gathered the proofs they needed to uncover Garamdoor and Blue Sagittarius&#8217; wrong doings, there was no need for the blue fox tribe siblings to take the law into their own hands.\nZect brought the rescued demi-humans to our guild and I asked the licenseless doctor living nearby to take care of their wounds, then we left the patients relax and sleep for the night. Meanwhile, Sakuya was able to get in touch with the wolf girl&#8217;s parents and she made them talk to the doctor to reassure them about their daughter&#8217;s conditions.\nAfter that&#8230; my bar was lively as always.\nMylarka and Yuma came to the bar and were now drinking with Aileen in their private room.\nRigel and McKinley had returned too and were sitting at Lia&#8217;s table. They noisily talked about their adventure and every now and then the tiger race girl, who was usually silent, chimed in their talk curtly to remind them she was unluckily paying attention to their words.\nI was sitting at the counter along with Mizuha, who was wearing a dress similar to Aileen&#8217;s and was hiding her fox ears with a hat, Zect, who sat alongside his sister, and Sakuya, who sat a bit far away from me. It was very rare for her to drink something at the bar, but tonight she felt like it and asked Verlaine a drink. It was carrot liquor blended with citrus juice.\n“Thank you for your hard work, Lady Sakuya. Today you look quite in high spirits.”\n“Yes. I always have a sense of fulfillment whenever I finish a job, but today I feel particularly fulfilled&#8230;”\nI would&#8217;ve loved to hear what they were talking about, but I decided to make Mizuha and Zect taste what I made for them.\n“Guys, try this out. I don&#8217;t know if it will fit your tastes, though.”\nI asked Verlaine about the liquor and the drink I made, and she placed two glasses in front of me. After checking them one last time, I made them slide toward their consumers.\n“T-This smell is&#8230; coconobi fruit mixed with goat&#8217;s milk&#8230; how do you&#8230;?”\nGoats were the most common livestock of cold places. Even the fox tribe – which descended from the blue fox tribe&#8217;s same ancestor – raised them, so I guessed that the siblings would be quite familiar with it.\nThe glass for Mizuha was a ‘coconobi shake’. It was made by skinning the coconobi fruit, mashing its white part, straining it, adding some spices and honey to balance the flavor and then shaking it with cold goat milk.\nThe one for Zect was ‘coconobi rum’. It was made by steeping the edible part of the fruit in the rum and waiting for its extract to flavor the liquor. Unluckily, I only had one day to do it, so I didn&#8217;t know how much I should&#8217;ve left it there, but it turned out good anyway.\nUnlike its white part, the blue skin of the coconobi fruit didn&#8217;t look very tasty, but once the edible part was soaked in rum, it started to turn a pale yellow and color the rum.\n“Take a sip. It should taste familiar to the blue fox tribe.”\n“When did you get this&#8230;? Did you know we were going to come here and prepared these in advance&#8230;?”\nI didn&#8217;t answer. Not everything went as I planned and I didn&#8217;t know if they would&#8217;ve liked their drinks.\n“Thanks for the treat. Mhh~! <em>Gulp! Gulp!</em>”\nMizuha held the glass with both her hands, and after the first sip, she started to gulp it down only to stop halfway.\n“It tastes like mom&#8217;s&#8230; It has the same flavor of the village&#8217;s&#8230; and it&#8217;s also&#8230;! My, who knew coconobi fruits could taste this good!”\nShe then returned to chug her drink down. Probably she didn&#8217;t drink much at the water cave.\nZect ended up doing the same: first he tasted the rum and opened his eyes wide in amazement, then he checked if his sister was liking her drink, and lastly he gulped his liquor down.\n“To warm our body in snowy days, we often drink alcohol. Where did you get the idea of steeping a coconobi fruit into liquor&#8230;?”\n“This is a bar and I love drinking nice stuff. I spend a lot of effort making drinks. Anyway, the most important part for me is that you liked it.”\nThe mug in front of me was filled with simple ale, but I had tasted their drinks before.\nIf I found a way to obtain coconobi fruits regularly, I could&#8217;ve added those drinks in the menu. Also, the nice part of those fruits was that they restored some magical power.\n“Being a Guild Master is such a wonderful job, isn&#8217;t it? We just met each other and yet you&#8217;re trying to make me feel at home&#8230;!”\nTears welled in Mizuha&#8217;s eyes as she recalled her hometown.\nVerlaine handed her a handkerchief, and Zect, looking at her sister tearing up, grabbed his glass, stood up and walked to me.\n“It tastes like home&#8230; Guild Master, sorry for taking me so long to ask, but could you keep taking care of us?”\nMizuha grabbed her glass as well and walked to me. Both of them handed them over waiting for my answer.\nI took my wooden mug and clinked it with the siblings&#8217; glasses.\n“Remember that I&#8217;m just a drunkard in this bar, so treat me accordingly. You&#8217;re forbidden from calling me Guild Master here.”\nThe siblings glanced at each other while Verlaine and Sakuya turned to look at me with a smile on their faces. They were clearly thinking ‘stop with that thing already’, but I couldn&#8217;t just stop following my principles out of the blue.\nWhen Zect and Mizuha understood what I meant, they both smiled—it was the first time he showed me one, and only then I realized that, as obvious as it was, even he could smile.\nI believed that was the true form of the man his sister knew so well.\n\n</p>\n","title":"Guild Master &#8211; Chapter 43","slug":"guildmaster-chapter43"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"guildmaster-chapter43","category":"after-defeating-the-demon-lord-he-became-guild-master"}}}
