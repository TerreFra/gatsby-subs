I made some money out of you brats, but this time I got pretty lucky.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man licked the blood from the blade of his sword as he laughed.<br />\nThe slave merchants sold the elf and now they came to take her back in order to sell her again.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They didn’t attack a random wagon, they already knew the goods were valuable.<br />\nIf they kept doing things like that, they would easily become rich.<br />\nOf course, it’s not something that could be done often, but it was clearly a good way to gain money.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Boss, what shall we do with these kids?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Well… let’s just get back the elf. I only used the others to persuade these merchants, since there’re a lot. Even keeping them alive is a nuisance.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the man mocked the children along with his comrades, he raised his sword over an unlucky child.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Kill us and you’ll kiss goodbye to the money.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As soon as Takumi said that, the man stopped.<br />\nRage and confusion painted his face as he turned to see who talked.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Brat, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Exactly what I said. The coachmen that you killed were talking about money before, saying that they received their payment. They had already been paid for the elf, plus a little extra… and they hid it in a box. You guys heard about it too, right?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Facing the children who were crying desperately, he saw them nod repeatedly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“If you hand it over right away, I’ll spare you.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Good to see we understand each other… but those two said the box has a strange mechanism. You can have the money only if you activate it correctly.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The children looked shocked at Takumi.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The coachmen didn’t only hide the box, but they also said that only a few people would be able to open it, and they didn’t say anything regarding the mechanism’s activation… Nevertheless, Takumi looked confident.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I know how to open it. Let us go as soon as you have it.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Very well… interesting. Then, let’s play…”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man said, then he grabbed Lilia and pulled her toward himself as he laid his sword on her neck.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“While you open it, I’ll kill someone every three minutes. Where’s the fun if there’s no spice on this matter?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He tightened his grip on her, as she was shivering and looking at Takumi as to ask him to save her.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But Takumi wore his usual warm smile as he looked back at her.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“It is more interesting, indeed. Those coachmen said so many things out loud that three minutes will be more than enough.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Good! Now, since you’re that confident, how about moving your ass?!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Sure, but I need the keys for the trapdoor where they hid the box.<br />\nAlso, I’d like you to take these shackles off, otherwise I could trip, since I’ll have to search in the dark.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man clicked his tongue, and as he rummaged in the corpse’s pockets, Takumi turned toward Karin and looked straight into her eyes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She knew what they had to do, but still, her face cramped.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Karin silently referred the message to Kunon, then, the bandit threw a set of keys to Takumi.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Hurry, or your friends will die.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Fine. I can’t see a thing, and finding the right key is no picnic.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Takumi showed the man a key as the set rattled.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“With this I can open the trapdoor. It’ll take an instant to open the box.<br />\nCan we forget about the three minutes rule?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Tch… just hurry up.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remarked the man, waiting for Takumi to give him the money.<br />\nThe child turned his back nonchalantly and squatted.<br />\nAs he smiled, he turned the key into the lock. <em>Clang</em>, the shackles opened.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The man was stiff and his smile disappeared from his face.<br />\nHe felt paralyzed, unable to grasp what just happened.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“What…?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As he whispered those words, he lowered his gaze.<br />\nHe saw his arm on the floor. The sword still in the grip of his hand.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“What… just…”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He couldn’t say another word.<br />\nFeeling his rib cage collapse with a loud sound of broken bones, the man was blasted out of the wagon.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Uff, I’m not strong when I can’t use my hands…”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Said Kunon with a disappointed expression, her golden fur fluttering.<br />\nBut no one minded her words.<br />\nThose attending the scene couldn’t grasp what happened. Lilia herself, the closest to the bandits, was too shocked to react.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The only thing clear for everyone was… that Kunon was a wolf-man, a powerful demi-human skilled in the art of war.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though the man’s blood splattered over her, she kept wearing the same radiant smile that she had when Takumi gave her bread.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“They… freed her!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the men close to the wagon screamed terrified.<br />\nHis voice overpowered the cackling of his comrades, who turned to see that gruesome scene.<br />\nNot caring about their boss anymore, the bandits started to flee at full speed, scattering as they saw a monster.<br />\nStill, the girl kept watching them like a wolf watches a lamb before tearing it to pieces.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Oh, are we playing tag? I’ve played it many times already! People praised me… when I catched and killed everyone.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“…Dumb dog! Who said you could kill them?!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The instant before she jumped, Takumi grabbed her by the scruff, and as he tightened his grip, she went stiff and stopped moving.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Ouchie! What are you doing?!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“There’s no need to kill them.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Oh, c’mon! It’s boring if I don’t kill them! Can’t I have some fun?!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She didn’t understand the reason he was stopping her.<br />\nA normal person would have wondered if she had a screw loose… but there’s someone who can understand that kind of logic.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Right, that’s boring. Then, let’s have some fun.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Yay! So I can kill them?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“No, stop it. Killing people is wrong.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kunon couldn’t understand his words and tilted her head.<br />\nTakumi wore the same twisted smile she had.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Don’t kill them for no reason, let them live. Don’t kill their boss either. It would be much more fun to watch him die slowly.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Takumi, on her same wavelength, proposed something even more atrocious before letting her go.<br />\nKunon remained frozen, unmoving.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Leaving her alone, Takumi started freeing the children from their shackles.<br />\nKarin was the last one, and when she was finally free, she stretched gently.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“How did you get the right key on the first try?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The set had fourteen keys, ten for the children and four for Karin and Kunon.<br />\nFinding the right key in darkness, and in such little time, wasn’t an easy task.<br />\nBut Takumi replied with his usual poker-face.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Since the merchants had the keys of our shackles but not of yours, they should have taken them when they bought you.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As he said so, he showed her the set.<br />\nA simple thread united the keys.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“In that case, your keys would have been the last ones.<br />\nAlso, since your shackles are made of different material, their keys should have been too.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since humans can’t see in darkness, they have to hone their senses to move in certain circumstances.<br />\nOnce he understood the keys’ position, finding them by touch was a matter of mere seconds.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Also, to bind Kunon they needed tougher shackles, so I only had to compare the last pair of keys of the set. Even if I were to get it wrong, I could have tried again, since it didn’t look like that guy wanted to keep playing. Anyway, it was really unlikely that he could see me.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Takumi smiled at her as he started to spin the set of keys around his finger.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Any other questions?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Seeing him that confident, she shrugged her shoulders and put on a wry smile.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“No. I also forgive you for using Kunon, but only because we’re safe now.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Go thank that guy. Now, time for the next move.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He approached the children who were huddled together.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Hey, anyone got hurt?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Takumi! Thanks! Thank you…!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lilia came running and hugged him, crying.<br />\nShe must have been the most scared, since she was threatened to be killed first.<br />\nThe other children also said words of thanks to him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The coachmen were dead and the bandits fled.<br />\nNo one was binding them anymore. They were finally free…</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Or so they thought.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“C’mon, we can’t stay here. Let’s go all together.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Go…? Where? Also, now that we’re free there’s no need to be together, right?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Commented Killfer, as he glanced at Kunon and Karin.<br />\nTakumi guessed their presence wasn’t really appreciated.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Of course, we should go where the merchants were bringing us as slaves. The horses are fine, so we should reach our destination without any more trouble.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Answered a smiling Takumi.<br />\nThe children didn’t understand his decision.<br />\nWhy would they choose to go back being slaves again, and this time by their own will?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“No… Forget it! Why on earth should I return to be a slave?!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As soon as Killfer voiced his thought, other children agreed with him.<br />\nTakumi expected that, so he started explaining.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“It’s true that we’re now free to do whatever we want, but where should we go? We could get caught again, starve to death, or live of thievery.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“But why should we go meet the coachmen’s boss?!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Because now they owe us a big one. I want to negotiate with them to make sure you guys live safe forever.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Takumi already thought about everything, so he smiled confidently.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“You have to become a slave again to be free in the future… but all of us need to stay together for this to happen.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course… the children hung their heads.<br />\nThey understood what he wanted to say.<br />\nIf they fled, nothing would have changed. Their life would have remained hell.<br />\nAlso, both bandits and slave merchants would have hunted them to get revenge.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But not every child was mature enough to leave the freedom they just gained behind, even though they understood it was the right choice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“…I’m in.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Said Lilia standing close to Takumi. The others children looked at her.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Lilia, are you kidding?! There’s no need to do what he’s asking for! We’re free now!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She shook her head at his objection.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Takumi is right. We might get caught again and if it doesn’t happen today, it might happen tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or the day after…”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She replied, and Killfer hung his head while gritting his teeth.<br />\nThey would have lived with the constant fear of being chased down. Their life wouldn’t be so different from before.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Also, Takumi saved me. He overcame an impossible situation, that’s why… I believe in him.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Killfer clicked his tongue after seeing her smile and turned to face the child near her.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Hey, can you really do this?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I’m ‘sure’ I can. I know that asking you something like this is crazy, but I’ll keep my promise.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Killfer sighed and hung his head in front of Takumi’s obnoxious, condescending smile.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“What should we do?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I’d love to tell you to leave everything to me, but some children still haven’t understood what we need to do, so I want you and Lilia to explain everything and convince them. If someone refuses, things will get complicated.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Explain…? Lilia is one thing, but I don’t know how to do it.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I’m sure you two can do this because of who you are. Let Lilia explain the situation, you will only push things a little when needed.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He looked conflicted, but decided to go with Lilia anyway.<br />\nWhen Takumi saw they were ready to go, he turned around after feeling someone behind him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Takumi… I have a favor to ask you.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kunon’s blond hair dazzled under the moonlight.<br />\nHer face frozen in a cold expression.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“People always told me to kill, and that’s all I ever did… I won’t let go of a life this fun.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her dead, golden eyes were emotionless.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“That’s why ‘leaving them alive’ was… interesting. If you could think of something like that, I guess you will think about many more interesting things.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her expression softened and returned to normal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“So… I’ll start from leaving you alive.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An innocent smile bloomed on her lips and Takumi smiled back at her.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://puu.sh/AIoT8/9785c6bdfa.png\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Nice. Feel free to kill me when you get tired.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Ugh… killing you will be hard, but it might be fun…”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“There’s no fun about squashing a fly, right? Anyway, keep your eyes peeled. I’ll show you a good time, but you have to work for me in return.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Leave it to me! I’ll obey your every order like a doggy!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After her reply, she got back on the wagon while wagging her tail.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Now that your friend made her choice, what will you do?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“…If Kunon remains, I shall too. You are truly interesting… and there are other things I’d like to see.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She pointed at his head.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I’ll ask again. Who are you?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Well, I can’t say I’m a normal person.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“You’re not normal…? It’s hard to believe.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I’ll do my best to make you believe it. We have a lot to talk about and having someone who can understand me right away can be useful.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since he didn’t have enough information about that world, who knows what consequences he would have to face if he said that he reincarnated.<br />\nKarin could read his mind thanks to her ability. She could find everything out over time, he didn’t need to tell her directly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Let’s save the small talk. Let’s retrieve the corpses and go.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I agree, but… why should we bring them with us?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Karin was used to see those corpses now, but she didn’t understand why they needed them too.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I said no one has to be missing. Of course, they’re not excluded.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After he closed the coachmen’s eyes and repositioned them with dignity, he dragged them in the wagon.<br />\nNeither the children, or Kunon and Karin, the coachmen or the bandits that attacked the wagon could be missing if they wanted negotiations to go smoothly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Since it’s pretty complex to explain, it’ll be faster for you to read it yourself.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“No, reading your mind is tiring. When I did it to know what we had to do earlier, I saw so many thoughts that I felt like puking.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Oh, that’s why you made that face. But from now on, I’ll make you read my mind, so you have to get used to it.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He said, and looking into each other’s eyes, Takumi got… a little too close, so Karin blushed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I-I’m not interested in a child… but I read that there’s an adult within you… this is complex…”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Thanks for the cute reaction. I enjoyed it.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“…I’ll punch you if you say that again.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Well, now you can read the answer you seek, but don’t do it if it makes you feel worse. It’s better if you take a deep breath and rest.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Yeah, I’ll pass for now… What do you want to do when we get there?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“I want to show the adults that they made a mistake.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Replied Takumi with his everlasting smile.</p>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 3","slug":"newgame-chapter3"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter3","category":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}}}
