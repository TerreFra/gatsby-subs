This means that we might add pieces to the original sentences, avoid to translate useless ones, change or drop redundant parts, and so on.<br />\nWe put understandibility and original meaning above the original words and phrasing.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">We will add a “consistency guide” in each of our project pages. Its use is to remember me (the translator) names, places and stuff.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">You’re welcome to send us an e-mail or drop a comment somewhere on this website for any question. We will read them and check our mail-box every once in a while, but remember that we’re forgetful slowpokes.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Our aim is to provide readers with quality and not quantity, and we’ll try our best to improve over time.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If you want to translate one or more of our projects, we’d prefer if you ask first and, in case we accept, credit us by leaving a link to our website in your project page or in the chapters you release.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>We will now accept donations. </strong>You can now pay for the next chapter of your favorite novel. We&#8217;ll priorize the paid series, but won&#8217;t neglect the others.<br />\nBy making a donation you accept that your money will be spent as we want, might it be for drinking a beer together, for upgrading our workstation, for buying something useless, for supporting the original authors of the series we are translating, or for whatever crosses our mind.<br />\nThank you for understanding.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>Please, refrain from talking about piracy and don’t share anything that might result in copyright infringement.
