They’re pretty serious if they came so far only to meet you.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The master carpenter noticed that Raiz didn’t want to talk about his past.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">He thought it was better to not ask anything and leave them alone.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Guys, the break has ended! Let’s go back to work!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Yeah!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The workers replied with a cheerful voice and immediately returned to their workstation.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz was really grateful for his consideration. After they all left, he once again faced his former comrades.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Why were you searching for me? How are things going in the army?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lety straightened her back as she looked at him.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">That’s exactly why we are here! Come back to us!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Never.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He declined her offer bluntly.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">W-Why?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">She squeaked in surprise.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Because I don’t want to come back when they fired me. How could you even think about it?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He blurted out the last part listlessly.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">The army coldly drove him away but was now begging for his forgiveness.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">He bet they were asking him that only because the Dragon Express was quite profitable.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I-I heard about that, but it’s an order from General Mard!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">General Mard?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz frowned when he heard that name.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Didn’t he retire?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He remembered that he retired due to his age after the end of the war.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">The one who succeeded him was an incompetent officer, the one who fired Raiz.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">He couldn’t be blamed for having this kind of reaction.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Mard heard that you were driven away and scolded his successor harshly, telling him that he didn’t even know the meaning of ‘deterrence’.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Merck tried to explain why the general wanted Raiz back.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">That’s why we came here personally to ask you to join us again.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I see.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">But Raiz didn’t sound interested in the matter.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">What’s with you! You will finally return to the army! Rejoice!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lety pouted at his discontent.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz, everyone in the army thinks that what has happened to you is unfair. Actually, each of the warriors that fought alongside you wishes to have you with us again.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He tried to persuade him while trying to calm Lety down.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I’m sure that a lot of people who can’t think about the future, thought of you as a hindrance, given the number of subordinates you have. But His Majesty himself permitted your reintegration, so don’t worry about what some noble or soldier thinks.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">The King, huh?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz was a commoner, so he didn’t become emotional when the King was named.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">He joined the army only to get fame and wealth, after all.<br />\n</span>Oh, and also for his monsters’ food expense.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Tamers and soldiers were treated differently.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Even showing the best he could do, he was never rewarded properly.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Some acknowledged his worth, but no one talked about his efforts or actions even during important ceremonies.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Knights descendants from nobles and the new general </span><span lang=\"en-GB\">only </span><span lang=\"en-GB\">thought about the room Raiz’s monsters took up, and scorned him to the point that the Lord of the thousand beasts became the laughing stock of the entire army.<br />\nThat’s also how normal people started to see tamers as bizarre entities.<br />\nFurthermore, the heads of the army intentionally manipulated some information to use Raiz’s potential to its fullest.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Sorry, but I’m satisfied with my new life. I have no intention of coming back with you.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">It looked like Raiz didn’t give it much thought. While Merck smiled wryly and Lety tried to control her boiling anger.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Mister Merck, Miss Lety, would you like some water?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Dryad offered them some water, and the tension loosened.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">O-Oh, hello Dryad. It’s been a while, how are you?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I’m fine, thank you. I’m sorry for offering you only this, but we don’t have tea.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Don’t worry, we had to came here on a forced march, so this is more than enough.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Merck thanked her as he brought the glass to his lips.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Ah, your water is really special.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Thank you.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He gave the glass back to her and looked at the monsters who were resting leisurely at the ranch.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I heard about the Dragon Express. It’s a great success, isn’t it?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz tried to answer vaguely. He knew that Lety would voice her anger if he gave her the chance to strike.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">It’s not going bad, I guess.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">You should be careful.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Merck moved his gaze over him with a serious face.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz, someone is going after you.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">My Lord~!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">A girlish voice reached them, and when they turned, Arachne was approaching them while carrying a big, white lump with her.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">The upper part of her body was a human’s, and her lower half was a spider’s.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">These suspicious guys have weapons, so I caught them~!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">…”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">An strange mood fell on the presents.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">You already took care of them, huh.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Merck lowered his head slightly, embarrassed for the seriousness he had shown a few moments before.</span></p>\n","title":"Monsters&#039; Guild &#8211; Chapter 13","slug":"monstersguild-chapter13","categories":[{"slug":"welcome-to-the-monsters-guild"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monstersguild-chapter13","category":"welcome-to-the-monsters-guild"}}}
