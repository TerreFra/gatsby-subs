Like them, the people living in the slums silently prayed to the sky.<br />\nVatel’s loss had been a shock for everyone.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Now that the mood was similar, everyone anxiously wondered if another funeral was going to take place.<br />\nSome of them were silently standing with their face cramped in an anxious and confused expression.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Takumi was simply sitting on a fountain’s bench, looking at the crowd.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It’s about time… where’s our leader?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Asked Geiz, who sat near him with an impatient smile.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A girl needs time to get ready. Patience is a man’s virtue.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Tch, now you think you know women? You really are annoying.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The moment he spat those words, the crowd started to stir.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Sorry for making you wait.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Her tender voice sounded cold like ice.<br />\nMirta wore a fur coat, Vatel’s favorite, over a simple dress.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Dressing took more time than expected.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">That must have been hard to wear for her, but she decided to show Valeria’s symbol.<br />\nShe was standing as a leader, not as a helpless girl.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Dear me! Can women change this much in a mere night?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Of course. I tried my best to make you fall for me, Takumi.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“It is such an honor. I admit that you charmed me quite a bit.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Quite a bit, huh…? Next time I should do better, then.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In her smile there wasn’t trace of doubt or worry.<br />\nHe nodded at her words, then got up.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We can now start discussing who will be Valeria’s next leader.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Announced Takumi quietly, but everyone heard him.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The candidates are Geiz Ejistan, the current proxy leader, and Mirta Famille, the current leader. Do you want to say something before the poll starts?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“There’s no need for something like that. The one who stands at the top will be followed even without a speaking a word. That’s what it means to be a real leader.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Geiz snorted, sure about his victory.<br />\nThe gaze of everyone shifted from his confident face to Mirta’s.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“If you can excuse me, I’d like to take a little of your time.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In the words of their leader was braided humility, but her eyes housed a fire comparable to her father’s.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The slums are a harsh place. A wasteland of nothingness… A valley where cold winds rob people of their warmth… And then, Valeria bloomed into a warm flower, thawing out its home… This is the meaning of the name my father chose, and I cannot help but love it.<sup><b><a class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/project/newgame-chapter11/#sdfootnote1sym\" name=\"sdfootnote1anc\">1</a></b></sup><b>”</b></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/z1yVXlB.png\" /></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She showed the crowd a tender smile.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Smiling together in happy moments, comforting someone in difficulty, getting mad when someone does something wrong… I want our existence to be like a warm, colorful family for the cold slums.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Everyone knew that she was just spouting her stupid ideals.<br />\nBut she would have never felt ashamed of expressing them.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“As Valeria’s leader… I will always be with all of you.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Her words resounded loudly because of her firm believe.<br />\n<i>Great performance</i>, thought Takumi.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“…Now, time to start the poll!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He announced loudly.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Choose the candidate you believe more fitting to be the next leader. If you want Geiz, kneel down and lower your head. If you want Mirta, raise your right arm.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Valeria’s members hung their heads and clutched their fists uncertain about what to do.<br />\nSeeing their doubt, Takumi rose his voice again.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“So, what’s your choice?! The stupid, gentle idealist… or the man who paid you like slaves?!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The curious bystanders started to murmur, while someone lost his cool.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“You bastard…! Spitting falsehood to avoid…”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Takumi poked the enraged Geiz with some parchment.<br />\nIn it were written the names of each member of Valeria, and a number alongside them.<br />\nThere were some big differences between those numbers.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This is how much you spent on them. A miser like you should remember that, no?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“W-What are you talking about?! That’s obviously fake!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“This choice is not up to you. They have to choose.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Ignoring the furious man, Takumi looked at the crowd.<br />\nThose who weren’t siding with Geiz were clutching their fists in rage.<br />\nPeople were divided into those who would’ve never betrayed him, who were the majority, and veterans who worked alongside Vatel and adored their former leader, who were the minority.<br />\nThat was the gap between new and old members.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">What Geiz did was deciding a price for that tag.<br />\nExactly like… they were a bunch of slaves.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“C’mon, decide for yourselves! Are you slaves waiting to be bought or prideful people chasing after an insane ideal?! Pick your choice!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Someone raised his right arm from the crowd, a leather bag of money in hand.<br />\nWhen it fell on the ground, a high-pitched sound echoed in the square.<br />\nAgain and again, the scene repeated itself, and more coins clinked around.<br />\nBut soon, no more hands imitated the others.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Takumi’s lips curled into a smile.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“And so be it! You are filthy slaves of the slums, and those who raised their arm are people of great integrity! Remember that pride can’t be bought by money!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Valeria’s members let out a roar at his exaggerated words. It was so loud that the whole slums seemed to shake, and maybe even reached the middle part of Listina.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“You… idiots! Are you really getting pumped up by the words of a filthy slave?!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Geiz was confused and angry at what was happening.<br />\nBut as he talked, the nearby bystanders shoot him down with poisonous words.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Close your trap, miser! You only know how to complain about money!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Your subordinates are mental! They should have protected my shop but kept destroying stuff while drunk!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Yeah, fuck you, pig! If you’re that unreliable, I should just kick their ass and get my money back!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In that storm of insults, people started to throw stones and garbage at him.<br />\nAs everyone turned their back at him and despair painted his face, Geiz screamed an order to his men.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“What are you waiting for! Kill them all! Leave the cheeky squirt alive and kill every traitor!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Oh, you think you can do that?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A lively voice reached him from his side.<br />\nKunon wore a cheerful smile as she grasped a dagger in each hand.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“If one of your dogs tries anything funny, I’ll rip their arms off. I’m really, really fast, you know. You won’t even draw your weapons. Wanna try?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Her warm smile only served to make her words more terrifying.<br />\nEvery member of Valeria knew the Hound’s strength.<br />\nThat’s why Geiz’s men started to shiver.<br />\nThe miser’s mouth opened and closed from anger and humiliation, while Takumi’s face was full of confidence.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Seems like you don’t belong to the slums. Can you leave already?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Don’t… Don’t think this is the end! You have no power compared to the major merchants! They will crush you!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Really? I’m looking forward to it.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Takumi’s gaze pierced Geiz with his bottomless black irises.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Return to your pigsty, you disgusting pig.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The man’s face flushed from anger, but since he was at a disadvantage, he couldn’t do anything but leave.<br />\nBoth he and his subordinates got away under a rain of stones and garbage, and once they weren’t in sight anymore, the turmoil slowly came to an end.<br />\nThen, Takumi let out a deep sigh.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Sorry for the ruckus. Today, Valeria has officially chosen its leader! What a glorious day! Let me take the opportunity to apologize and ask you a favor!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He lifted a leather bag from the ground and held it high.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Our leader said the slums are like a family for her, and families should celebrate together!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He then put his other hand in the bag and extracted its contents, which were thrown into the air without sparing a single coin.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Let’s use the money to pay for food and drinks! It’s time to celebrate our new leader!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Shouts of joy resounded in the square.<br />\nValeria’s members imitated Takumi’s gesture, and the shopkeepers started to bring wine and food, moved by the scene.<br />\nIt looked like another festival was going to start.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Aaah… It became quite something.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Said Karin, approaching Takumi from the midst of the crowd.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Well, it’s better this way.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I agree. You acted like Geiz, though.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The man bought trust with money, while Takumi gained trust from scattering money.<br />\nThere wasn’t much difference between the two. If anything, the young slave merchant was corrupting people for the better.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Well, this is the difference between first-class slave merchants and third-class ones.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“In your case, we should add ‘scheming’ before ‘slave merchant’. Poor Elsa, handling you must be a pain.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Isn’t that fine? This way, she can see Mirta more often.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“She will get sick if you keep this up…”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While Karin imagined her friend and wore a pitiful expression, Kunon was running toward them producing a soft pitter-patter with food in her hand.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Look Takumi! They gave me a lot of food!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Good for you! It must be good now that you finished your work!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Yeah! Fupeh yummy!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She started to stuff her mouth with various treats. The cute girl who was standing there until a moment before was nowhere to be found.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I’ll go grab some food too before they get me into custody.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Err… Wait a minute, I have something to tell you.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Turning to face Karin, Takumi saw her toothy smile.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Thank you… for getting mad at that pig for us yesterday.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Trying to hide her embarrassment, she spoke while playing around with her black hair.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Yeah, thank you! I also felt all better when I saw that!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Said Kunon smiling innocently, and Takumi also curled his lips.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“That was a natural action as your employer.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He turned his back at them, and the girls walked around him to peer at his face.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“What’s that? Takumi, don’t tell me you’re embarrassed.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Woah, that’s even rarer than him getting angry! Lemme see!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I’m not embarrassed. I mean, who was the blushing elf between us?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3mIoTBf.png\" /></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“What?! I wasn’t blushing! I’m older than you, how can I possibly get embarrassed by just praising someone?!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Karin, Karin! You’re not convincing anyone, you know?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">When Kunon pointed that out, Karin’s face flushed again.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“C’mon, we still have something to do. Let’s grab some food and get to work, young lady.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Ggh… I swear I’ll make you cry one day…”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Ah, then I’ll also do that! I’d love to try making Takumi cry!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Kunon, don’t plan on beating me up, please.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The three merged into the crowd and enjoyed the festival.<br />\nThey had to take the chance to rest, given how exhausting the next days were going to be.</p>\n<hr />\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a class=\"sdfootnotesym\" href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/project/newgame-chapter11/#sdfootnote1anc\" name=\"sdfootnote1sym\">1</a> <span lang=\"zxx\"><u><a class=\"western\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_of_the_valley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_of_the_valley</a></u></span> read the introduction and “cultural symbolism” parts to understand this better.</p>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 11","slug":"newgame-chapter11","categories":[{"slug":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter11","category":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}}}
