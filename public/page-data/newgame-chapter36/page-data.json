The ceremonial sword tied to her hips reminded everyone of the official status of the match.\n“It has been&#8230; a wonderful match, Suzuran&#8217;s members.”\nAfter hearing her words, the three of them rose their heads.\n“Lord Elvis extolled your brave fight, and I can do nothing but agree with him and approve of his choice. Today, we will also hold the ceremony to baptize you winners as knights.”\nTakumi glanced at Elvis, who sat a few steps behind Eluria, but couldn&#8217;t read any concern on his face.\n“I am deeply delighted by the words Her Majesty has addressed to my subordinates. Their victory was blessed by our Goddess Filia, thus they should aim to become our Queen—Filia&#8217;s closest entity&#8217;s—sword.”\n“Eheheh&#8230; Hearing you mouthing wise words is hilarious&#8230;”\n“&#8230;Your Highness, please, refrain from murmuring something in the middle of your talk.”\n“Why, are you in a bad mood, Lux?”\n“I am not. But whenever that slave merchant does the impossible, I receive a lot of exhortation, so my stomach is hurting a little.”\nLux, who sat behind her, managed to smile despite the twitching of his cheek.\nNearby him, an old man adjusted his glasses on his nose.\n“Ohohh&#8230; It looks like you are going to rack your brain, Lord Lux. That man you have set your eyes on is earning a title, so should you not be happier?”\n“&#8230;I am obliged for your observation, Lord Cramer. I envy how you avoid problems and hardly have to deal with any.”\n“Ohohh&#8230; Dealing with problems and discord is the way of doing of the harmonious Administer. Whenever we find a lull sea, we never know what boils deep within it.”\nCramer Administer, the overlord who carried Richtert&#8217;s national politics on his shoulders as the prime minister and also controlled the cabinet ministers, replied to Lux&#8217;s cynicism while shaking his mustaches.\nHe was a crafty man who acted to maintain harmony and stability in his country.\n“Forgive this old man for butting in your conversation, Your Highness. I am sorry.”\n“Well, you better be. We are in the middle of a public speech.”\n“Ohohh&#8230; I did not expect to be rebuked like this&#8230;”\n“&#8230;Can any other unnecessary conversation stop now? None are worth these people&#8217;s time.”\nMaybe afraid that their talk would last too long, Elvis cut it down with a sharp voice, and pushed the Queen, who looked at him with a wry smile, to go on and face Takumi again.\n“Lord Lux will notify you with the details of the lands you will be put in charge of after your subordinates become knights. I also have a personal matter I want to discuss with you, slave merchant.”\nAs Eluria mouthed those words, she exchanged looks with Lise, who was still standing behind the throne—her usual sour look plastered on her face.\nThe child took a step toward Takumi while tightly pressing her lips together.\n“&#8230;I cannot believe you really won.”\n“I was hoping to hear ‘I believed in your victory’, though.”\nHearing him joking around, she squeezed her staff tighter along with her lips.\n“I should not believe&#8230; that is why I gave up.”\nAfter crushing her personal beliefs, the only thing that was left for her was to obey.\nShe gave up because she believed that she could&#8217;ve never won that fight.\nIt couldn&#8217;t be helped—that justification was what helped her bear her current life.\n“Did you like the apple pie, Archbishop Lise Crest?”\n“&#8230;Yes. It was so delicious it made me feel better.”\nHis simple question cleared her face from any shadow as she answered with a beaming cherubic smile.\nTakumi nodded in satisfaction.\n“I heard Her Highness&#8217; words clearly. I will abide by Lord Lux&#8217;s details once I receive his notification.”\n“Look forward to it. Now&#8230; we cannot let people wait any more. As a boring ceremony, Let us hold it right away.”\nSaying so, Eluria stood up and unsheathed her sword, the symbol of the royal family—the blue of its blade was clearer than the sky&#8217;s and deeper than the sea&#8217;s—and lowered it on Kunon and Karin, as they both kept their heads bowed.\n“In the name of Eluria Richtert, your queen, I hereby grant you the title of knight. By the power vested on you, I ask your loyalty to my country.”\nThe flat part of her sword touched their shoulders, and once the queen finished the ceremony, thus marking the official end of the match, Takumi&#8217;s comrades, silent until that moment, rose their heads again.\nThe audience bursted in excited cheers for the last time that day.\n\n</p>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 36","slug":"newgame-chapter36","categories":[{"slug":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter36","category":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}}}
