We already fixed it. My apologies.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Those who hide in the forest</h3>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz had two kinds of subordinates.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The first one was composed of monster with sheer strength as their main characteristic.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Dragon, Lamia, Treant and Dryad belonged to this group, along with other.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Their abilities shone on the battlefield, and they were recognized as a valuable fighting force. </span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">What about the others?</span> <span lang=\"en-GB\">They mainly acted in the shadows.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">For example, Cat sith could gather a frightening amount of information despite his uselessness on the battlefield, and Arachne possessed top-notch restraining skills. There were many monsters that could use their abilities while hiding.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Among them, the most proficient ones were part of the </span><span lang=\"en-GB\">shadow</span><span lang=\"en-GB\"> unit.<br />\n</span>Some were known only by a few people of the army, while others were known only by their tamer.<br />\n<span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz ordered them to move, and so they raised the curtains on their stage.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"CENTER\">◆</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Meanwhile, in the Forest of Monsters, the domain of creatures that didn’t like the presence of humans&#8230;</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Sam was captured.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Said a figure fully dressed in black clothes. Its comrades, who were dressed in a similar way, shivered. It was hard to understand if that voice belonged to a man or a woman, probably because of some sort of alteration.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">His monsters did it.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">As expected from a talented man. I guess he could sense our presence and move his pieces accordingly thanks to his military training.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Captain, what should we do with Sam?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Kill him. It will be bad if Tend citizens were to know that we are involved.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The captain ordered for their comrade disposal without a second thought.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">He was taken into custody by Tend&#8217;s knights. It&#8217;s probable that they would notice something if we kill him.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Then kill everyone. Dead men tell no tales.<br />\n</span>If we can bring our real target home, no one will know the truth.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Five black-dressed figures started to head silently toward the city.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Those suspicious men, Serga&#8217;s special forces, were now in charge of scouting Raiz.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Their mission was to persuade the tamer to join their ranks, and if he were to refuse, they had to dispose of him in secrecy.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I wonder if he will really accept. I mean, weren&#8217;t we enemies during the war?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Who knows. Still, even though he fought for this country, he was driven away by some incompetent general without being even acknowledged as a hero. He’s supposed to bear some grudges against them, so I don&#8217;t think he will be loyal to that army.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz&#8217;s sudden dismissal was never made public by Tent, but t</span>hanks to their espionage skills,<span lang=\"en-GB\"> Serga’s soldiers knew about it.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Still, to keep an eye on the main reason of our defeat is&#8230;”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Another one voiced its discontent.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Soldiers live only to carry out their superiors&#8217; orders. They can even join the enemy&#8217;s forces if necessary.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">But what&#8217;s the point of joining the ranks of a kingdom that’s on its knees? Thinking about it rationally, there&#8217;s nothing to earn from that. Our army is exhausted, and if I was him, I might change my mind only for a huge sum of money&#8230;”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">That’s our superior&#8217;s job. We only have to fulfill our mission, nothing more.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Those words were a signal.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">They remained silent, but one of them noticed that something was off.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">&#8230;”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The figure tried to ask its companions if they felt the same thing, but&#8230;</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">&#8230;?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">It was trying to speak, but nothing came out of its mouth.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Feeling that something strange was happing, the others attempted to do the same, but no one could produce even a whisper.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">The world around them was devoid of sounds.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">The insects&#8217; noise, the beasts&#8217; call, the rustling of leaves: nothing could be heard.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Silence ruled over everything.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The soldiers got closer to each other and formed a ring to defend from the incoming enemy.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">As they peered into the shadows, their leader stood on guard at the center of the formation.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Usually, they would follow its instructions, but because of the situation, they just kept scanning their surroundings.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Then, they were shocked by another fact.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The crescent moon dimly lit their surroundings, so they thought this was the chance to see what was happening around them.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Still, it was like they were blindfolded.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">&#8230;?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Blinded and deafened, they started to tremble.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">They were highly trained, but this situation was totally out of their expectations.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">They couldn&#8217;t observe their surroundings anymore, and confused as they were, they wondered what was going on and how their comrades were doing.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Still, relying on their remaining senses, they tried to feel any occurring change.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">A sweet scent filled the air.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">They tried to recall if they smelled it before, but their legs ceased to support them, and they fell to the ground.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Panic gripped their hearts.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">One of them thought that some medicine could be behind all of this, but when he tried to tell the others, its soundless voice reached no one.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">It tried to take an antidote, but its arms couldn&#8217;t move.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">A few moments later, their whole bodies were paralyzed, and they lost consciousness.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"CENTER\">◆</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The darkness dispersed, and monsters walked out from the forest.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Mission complete.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Great job~”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">It went well!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">They started to praise each other&#8217;s doing in a cheerful mood.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">A half-human, half-spider monster, a humongous mushroom with limbs, a tiny winged human-shaped creature, and a beast so black that it seemed covered with ink.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">They were Raiz&#8217;s shadow unit.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">What are we gonna do with them~?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Asked Pixie while swaddling one of the collapsed human&#8217;s heads with Arachne&#8217;s thread.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Pixies are known as mischievous fairies, but they&#8217;re also talented wind users.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">He obstructed the sound’s propagation, causing that surreal silence.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Can I make some mushrooms grow on them?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Asked Matango.</span> <span lang=\"en-GB\">This monster is literally a huge mushroom.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">It can&#8217;t move keenly, but it can produce spores from its cap that paralyze other creatures.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Woof!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The ink-black creature warned Matango to stop.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Uwah! Okay, fine. I&#8217;ll just follow our boss&#8217; orders.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Black dog was a big, frightening monster that usually appears in cemeteries.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">He caused the humans to lose their sight by filling their vision with shadows.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I&#8217;ll carry these guys. You can carry the ones we seized before to our Master.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I&#8217;ll leave it to you~! I can&#8217;t do a thing myself, so I&#8217;ll just go back home.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Said Pixie while entrusting his duty to his comrades and flying up in the sky.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Fine. Let&#8217;s get to work.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Woof.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">While Matango surrendered to its fate, Black dog barked.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Oh, will you help me?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The hound nodded and extended its shadow beneath the humans, who slowly sunk in the blackness.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Okay, let&#8217;s go~!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">They started to head back home after Arachne&#8217;s command.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">They were looking forward to their master&#8217;s praises.</span></p>\n","title":"Monsters&#039; Guild &#8211; Chapter 16","slug":"monstersguild-chapter16","categories":[{"slug":"welcome-to-the-monsters-guild"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monstersguild-chapter16","category":"welcome-to-the-monsters-guild"}}}
