How lucky to get another chance!”<br />\nA humanoid shape appeared from the void scene and spoke with an inappropriate voice.<br />\n“How much did you last? Around seven years?”<br />\nHer behavior remained, but that was to be expected from an existence like that.<br />\n“It&#8217;s been a while, Goddess.”<br />\n“Ah, if I could choose, I&#8217;d never meet you again&#8230;”<br />\nHer smile cramped, but after sighing, she quickly recomposed herself.<br />\n“I can&#8217;t believe you survived for that long&#8230; with that cheeky behavior of yours, I thought you were going to die in a jiffy. I even wished for it.”<br />\n“Are you really a Goddess?”<br />\n“That&#8217;s rude, of course I am! A middle-ranked one, at least.”<br />\nShe answered while puffing her abundant chest with pride. Takumi sighed and glared at her stupid reaction.<br />\n“Okay, I guess&#8230; Listen, do you understand that you didn&#8217;t grant my wish as I asked?”<br />\n“Eh? Didn&#8217;t you want to reincarnate as a slave of some harsh world while keeping your abilities and look?”<br />\n“Yeah, you did exactly what I wanted, but&#8230; you forgot about a detail and added something, didn&#8217;t you?”<br />\nHis gaze was as sharp as a blade. She shrugged her shoulders and let her long, platinum hair sway behind her.<br />\n“Oops, you found me out?”<br />\n“Of course. Even an idiot could’ve connected the dots.”<br />\nReplied him while remembering two girls.<br />\nKunon, a blonde, lively wolf-girl with gold-colored eyes, and Karin, a gloomy elf with black, silky hair.<br />\nDemi-humans whose power transcended human&#8217;s, captured exactly when he was reincarnated.<br />\n“There&#8217;s a limit to human&#8217;s luck. Why did you do that?”<br />\nHe pointed at her, who wore a shy expression.<br />\n“I&#8230; thought it was bad if you died the moment you awakened&#8230; I&#8217;m a Goddess, after all&#8230;”<br />\n“Remember what I said, senile Goddess.”<br />\n“I&#8217;m not senile! I have this faint feeling of having been alive a long time ago, but I&#8217;m definitely not senile!”<br />\n“Who cares about your mental condition, just tell me what your goal was.”<br />\nTakumi lowered his voice, and she smiled.<br />\n“Let me answer with a question. Why do you think we make people reincarnate?”<br />\n“I have no idea.”<br />\n“Oh, c&#8217;mon~! You&#8217;re pretty quick-witted&#8230; or rather, I might even say you were the smartest in your original world. You know the reason, don&#8217;t you?”<br />\nShe laughed, amused, but he didn&#8217;t answer.<br />\n“Anyway, rest assured. You were reincarnated in the lowest social class of that world. Sorry for nudging you a little&#8230; Right, what about some power for this time?”<br />\n“Sure, only if I can punch you to death.”<br />\n“That would be a bit extreme, don&#8217;t you think?!”<br />\n“You reap what you sow. I reincarnated only to test my own abilities.”<br />\nHe couldn&#8217;t use them to their fullest in his original world, so his regret brought him to wish for an environment where he was free to use them as he wished.<br />\n“Still, without those two you would’ve died, no? C&#8217;mon, show some gratitude to this concerned Goddess.”<br />\n“Try to intervene again and I won&#8217;t just promise to beat you, retarded Goddess.”<br />\n“Did those sound like words of gratitude to you?!”<br />\n“Also, if I was alone, with my limbs tied and ignorant of the world&#8217;s language, the result would have been the same. I&#8217;d have escaped and survived anyway.”<br />\n“Eeeh? If that was true, it&#8217;d be really boring.”<br />\n“Well, sorry for ruining your mood. Anyway, since last time I couldn&#8217;t dispel my regret, don&#8217;t help me at all from now on.”<br />\n“Okay, fine&#8230; I won&#8217;t make it happen again, and neither will I help you in the future. Test your abilities as much as you want.”<br />\nShe eventually reached her limit and surrendered while drooping her shoulders.<br />\n“I already understood that you&#8217;re way more talented than the average human, so I don&#8217;t mind letting you do whatever you want, since I will still achieve my goal.”<br />\n“I don&#8217;t know or care about what you are scheming, as long as I&#8217;m free to do what I want. Anyway, I have a lot left to do, so bring me back, please.”<br />\n“My duty is also finished. Now I have a headache because of you&#8230; There, go into that light and you will wake up.”<br />\n“Okay. Call me if you want to have another headache.”<br />\nAs he started to walk toward his destination, her voice reached him again.<br />\n“What do you think about that world?”<br />\nHer tone was totally different from before, as it was now tinted with sadness.<br />\nTakumi turned to let her see his smiling face.<br />\n“It&#8217;s not bad.”<br />\nHearing his answer, the Goddess smiled bashfully.<br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/k0k6TSl.png\" /></p>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 20","slug":"newgame-chapter20","categories":[{"slug":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter20","category":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}}}
