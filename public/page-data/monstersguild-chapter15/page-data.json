You will become one eventually. Anyway, I have a favour to ask you.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">What might it be?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Frida got on his feet and approached the knight.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Mard, the former general, asked His Majesty to make Raiz Tamer join the army again.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He pronounced the word ‘former’ with a lot of emphasis.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Really?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“‘<span lang=\"en-GB\">His monster army frightened other countries and acted as a repellent. Dismissing it was a foolish move’, he said.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Frida looked annoyed.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><i>It was quite stupid, indeed.</i></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Merck shared the same opinion as Mard.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The man in front of him didn’t have any combat experience.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">As the son of an influential noble, he became a royal knight without stepping into a real battlefield even once.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">As the name suggests, a royal knight was the last line of defence of the capital.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">It should have been the most important role, filled with the strongest warriors.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">But a capital was the last place to attack in war.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Usually, the strongest were called to help the front lines.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Thanks to that, the royal knights became ridiculous shadows of real knights. It was a brigade filled with utterly incompetent people…</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Yes, ‘incompetent’ was the only word to define the man who stood in front of Merck.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Our glorious army doesn’t need any tamer! Also, what knight would rely on filthy monsters?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><i>If it wasn’t for him, this country would have been conquered long ago.</i></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Thought Merck, but since he was standing in front of his momentary boss, he let the conversation move on.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">You are a keen observer, General.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He lied to meet his expectations.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Never going against a superior was the key of success and longevity.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I knew you could understand me! I couldn’t expect less from viscount Zeit’s son!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Merck’s eyebrow twitched imperceptibly, and the man in front of him, who was oblivious to that reaction, kept talking.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I want you to join the knight sent by Mard and prevent Raiz to join the army again!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Yes, sir!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><i>I hate this. I don’t want to hinder a friend’s duty and Raiz’s return…</i></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Thinking that, he started to understand the feeling of betraying a friend.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><i>Still, work is work.</i></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"CENTER\">◆</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">That’s it, Meowster. I acquired this information from a cat sith who lives in the capital, so it can’t be wrong.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Cat siths barely had any combat ability. They were speaking cats, after all.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Still, even though they looked like useless creatures, they hid an amazing ability.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">They could share their consciousness among themselves.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">They could get in touch and exchange information with each other even at a great distance.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz tried to ask Cat Sith how it works, but he replied that it was the keystone of their trading business, so he couldn’t just explain that.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I see. Seems like the army is falling apart.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><i>A political strife right after a war? What a bunch of idiots.</i></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Also, the men that Arachne has caught are spies from the neighbour kingdom. They had to keep an eye on you, Meowster.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">They were scouts? Not assassins?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Purrecisely.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz let out a deep sigh.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">While scratching the cat’s chin with his fingers, he started to think about his next move.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Let’s take care of those shady troublemakers first.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Purr…? Are you serious?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Cat sith smiled at Raiz while purring.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Yes. It’s been a while since I mobilized the shadow unit.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The time for his counterattack had come.</span></p>\n","title":"Monsters&#039; Guild &#8211; Chapter 15","slug":"monstersguild-chapter15"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monstersguild-chapter15","category":"welcome-to-the-monsters-guild"}}}
