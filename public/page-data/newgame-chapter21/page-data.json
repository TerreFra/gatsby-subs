A big shot complained about the reorganization of the facility located in the upper part.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">A big shot&#8230;?

One of the three overlords?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Yes. Even Lux can&#8217;t do a thing against them.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Listina&#8217;s royal family, and more precisely the queen, had the strongest influence in the capital, but the national politics were in the hands of those who were called ‘three overlords.’\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The righteous Fairstadt, who ruled over justice, the harmonious Administer, who managed the administration, and the valiant Fortesea, who ruled over war.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Those three weren&#8217;t only the three duchies of the kingdom, but also the delegates of Richtert&#8217;s magic.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">In the Holy Kingdom of Richtert, worshipping magic as a godsend was a national custom. The privileged nobles were selected to learn Richtert&#8217;s peculiar magic.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The strongest were a step above the others even on a social level, and among them were the aforementioned overlords.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">They were leagues above the other aristocrats.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">But&#8230; we only changed our facility. What is that Fortesea guy complaining about?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Remember the defensive magic tools I removed from the former Amberg&#8217;s facility? Seems like we should bring them back because there&#8217;s a problem.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Well&#8230; complaining won&#8217;t help, huh? But we are also a major company that participates in the state management, so getting robbed or assaulted would be troubling.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The nobles&#8217; mansions and the major companies&#8217; headquarters were important facilities for the national politics, so a lot of magic tools were created to defend them.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">But since Takumi wasn&#8217;t authorized to remove and re-utilize them as he wanted, it was only natural that the Fortesea, who carried the national defense on their shoulders, would complain about what he did.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The slave merchant brought a hand on his chin while staring at the papers.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The slums are a thing, but robbery and assaults hardly occur in the upper part. I&#8217;d understand this turn of events if we were in the middle of a war, but there haven’t been big conflicts for the last thirty years. Still, the next day we dismantled them, we got Geiz&#8217;s report about the complaints.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Takumi tapped on his temple with his index finger again and again.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Let&#8217;s see, what should we do about this&#8230;”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">&#8230;Are you planning something again?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Of course.

Otherwise I won’t have enough time to fulfill them.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">You&#8217;ll be the very first to know. Also, your help will be essential for executing the plan. You&#8217;re the only one who can understand what my aim is, after all.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">&#8230;I guess it&#8217;s fine, then.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">She sulked and turned her head to hide her embarrassment, but her ears betrayed her as they started to turn red.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Let&#8217;s start with telling Geiz to dispose of those magic tools.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I don&#8217;t think you should&#8230; People would kill for them.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Magic tools, as the name suggests, were tools enchanted with magic.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">They could use magic when activated</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">, and their user-friendliness made them ideal devices for the military, peddlers and thieves, who never had enough of them.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Still, those tools weren&#8217;t created only from rare materials, they also needed the ‘Law formula’, which was the magic formula that composed their core.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Only skilled mages</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">, namely those who understood the right method to write those formulas, could write them, so the distribution of magic tools was lacking compared to the demand.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Also, if those tools were Amberg&#8217;s, they should be made by Crest&#8217;s archbishop. Did you know that they are the best in the whole capital?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Crest&#8230;? Those who changed completely the magic tools used by mages<b> </b></span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">two years ago?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Exactly. They also created Seizing Magic for guards, and the defensive barriers you want to dispose of, along with pretty much every magic tool you can find in the upper part of the capital. They are all made by the same archbishop.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Wow&#8230; How much do we know about this one?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Almost anything. He shows up only in the royal castle or in the cathedral. Not even our slaves are allowed to enter those places.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She meant the network of slaves that they created in all those years.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Thanks to them, Takumi could acquire any sort of information.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">But they were limited to their employers and those who were close to them. It was quite difficult to gather information about the important structures of the upper part, especially the castle and the cathedral.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lux could give them a hand, but given his personality and position as one of the three overlords, the level of confidence was different than what Takumi had with his articles.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">If slaves can&#8217;t access those places, I have to think of another way to gather information from there.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">I agree. I&#8217;d like to use Geiz better, but the hierarchy of the upper part&#8217;s branch isn&#8217;t ready yet, so we have to wait for some time&#8230;”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">&#8230;It must be fun to talk to each other while I starve, huh?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Commented Kunon while staring at the others.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Especially you, Karin. You look happier than usual whenever you talk with him.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Happier&#8230;? I don&#8217;t think so, though?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">That&#8217;s a lie! You&#8217;re smiling!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Wh&#8230;?! I&#8217;m not smiling!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Karin immediately started touching her cheeks to confirm it.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">See?! I&#8217;m not! I&#8217;m the same as ever!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Okay, stop you two. Karin, you just look relaxed, and it&#8217;s only normal that you smile every once in a while, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">How many times must I repeat myself?!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Takumiii! Gimme food, pleeease!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">As the girls lost their focus completely, Takumi waved his hand and sighed.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Fine. I have to hear Killfer&#8217;s report anyway, so let&#8217;s finish a little early today.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Really?! Yaaay!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Hearing the great news, Kunon&#8217;s eyes started to sparkle and her ears to twitch, and a broad grin formed on Karin&#8217;s face.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">I heard his report before coming here. He asked me to tell you that the Holy Text&#8217;s script was spread, and everyone received it.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Oh, that&#8217;s good to hear. Well, there&#8217;s no reason to go there, then.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Nooo! Karin, you big idiooot!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">That&#8217;s what you get when you say weird stuff!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Asserted the elf with her face flushed red and her lips bent in a childish grin.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The werebeast started to hit her lightly as her dreams shattered.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Meanwhile, Takumi started to tidy up the workplace, since it didn&#8217;t look like things were going to proceed any further. At that moment, someone knocked on the door and opened it.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Takumi, do you have a minute?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">A girl entered the room, her platinum hair swaying in the air.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Hey Mirta, what&#8217;s up? I was about to take a break.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">You have a guest&#8230; Girls, what happened?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">She cocked her head, looking at a flushed Karin and a desperate Kunon on the verge of tears.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Nothing, just a shyness stroke and polyphagia. So, someone wants to see me?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">It was a bit late for visits, since it was almost midnight, but another person entered the room. It was a girl with long, flame-red hair tied in a ponytail wearing a snow-white uniform.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Seeing her, Karin let out a surprised voice.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Elsa? It&#8217;s strange for you to drop by this late at night.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Well, my shift just ended, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m this late.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">What, you came here at this hour to make sure that I’m not causing some trouble?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">&#8230;Listen, even I wouldn&#8217;t be that brazen, okay?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Currently, Suzuran and the guards of the slums were collaborating.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Although they were an illegal company before, now they were one of the major companies selected by the Holy Kingdom of Richtert itself to manage the public affairs, and their current headquarter resided in an office with a surreal quantity of paperwork.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">That&#8217;s why they didn&#8217;t only keep in touch with each other, but a strong guard was put in charge of defending them.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Before, the guards avoided dropping by as much as possible, but now they brazenly walked in and out.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">So you came here because there&#8217;s something urgent you need?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">No, nothing urgent&#8230; wait, what happened to that wolf-girl.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Sob&#8230; Captaaain&#8230;! Gimme some food pleeease&#8230;!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Kunon was walking unsteadily toward her new hope with a strange expression plastered on her face. </span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Oh, are you hungry? That&#8217;s good. I was wondering if it was too late&#8230; They gave me a lot of extras at the bar, so&#8230;”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She offered Kunon a paper bag, and the next moment, strength returned in her petite body. The werebeast&#8217;s eyes started to sparkle, and she hugged the guard tightly.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Yaaay! Captain you are&#8230; a goddess!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Woah, calm down! Here, eat this! Get off&#8230; Don&#8217;t drool! You&#8217;re gonna stain my uniform! Get off me! Slave merchant, stop watching and help me!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Screamed Elsa trying to push Kunon away.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://puu.sh/AMqSW/a9bc39888a.png\" /></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The three witnesses nodded with sympathy.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">That&#8217;s peaceful.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Peaceful, indeed.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">How peaceful, is it not?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Stop looking so calm and help me!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Kunon finally reached for her food and checked the paper bag while Elsa sat on a nearby chair.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Jeez&#8230; today I&#8217;m not here as a patrol, but as a messenger. Brother Lux asked me to.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Takumi wore a dubious expression, and then she took out a letter from her breast pocket.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">A royal buffet will be held three days from now to celebrate your promotion. The royal family, three overlords, four major companies, and all the influential nobles who have the right to speak will be present&#8230; there will be quite a lot of people.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I see. You came to warn us.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Your invitation was written by Her Majesty the Queen herself. Actually, it should have been held in the near future, but a certain major company has been redesigned earlier than expected.</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">She kept talking after making Kunon sit on her lap.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Rather than a party, they want to remind you of your position. National politics are discussed in congresses, but since in this case we&#8217;re talking about a </span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">formal</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"> gathering, </span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">it will be hard to grasp other people&#8217;s attitude. </span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">This buffet serves as a mean to share intel and exchange ideas.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Oh, thanks for explaining. I don&#8217;t have much information regarding the upper part of Listina, so accepting this invitation might actually help me gather some.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Takumi smiled happily, and the guard looked at him with dubious eyes.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">&#8230;Don&#8217;t try to do anything funny, okay? If you do something, the Fairstadt family, meaning me and Lux who recommended you, will get in trouble. Understood?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Why would I do something funny?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Because you always do?! Ugh, my stomach&#8230;”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She started to pat her stomach with an uneasy expression on her face.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">That happened whenever she tried to deal with Takumi.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Mirta&#8230; I&#8217;m counting on you. Keep him at bay.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Eh? Am I also invited?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Of course. It&#8217;s only natural that a major company&#8217;s leader would be invited, no? Also, you know how to behave and have the proper manners to participate, don&#8217;t you?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">I-I indeed learned a lot from the time we practiced etiquette together at your residence, but&#8230;”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">She didn&#8217;t only think too much over things, but imagining to participate at a gathering where the royal family and the three overlords would be present made her so nervous that her gaze started to wander aimlessly through the room.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Mirta, it would be good to be a bit more confident, you know?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">I-I already am!”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Seeing her sticking her chest out, Takumi nodded satisfied.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">That&#8217;s it. No matter the place or the opponent, just keep looking good. Prepare to look down on the three overlords, the royal family and even the gods if necessary.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">W-What was that&#8230;? Why can I picture you doing it so easily?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Because I&#8217;d do that even if a goddess went against me.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Listen&#8230; if someone hears you saying that, it wouldn&#8217;t be strange for the inquisition to drag you away, you know? People worship the Goddess Filia here, don&#8217;t forget it.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Rebuked a disgusted Elsa, but since he already treated the Goddess of Reincarnation with insolence, he was only stating the truth.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Anyway, just take care of your look. Also, she is more or less the sister of one of the overlords. If you feel uneasy, practice in front of her.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I am a proper sister, if anything! But he has a point, Mirta. If you need me, I&#8217;ll help you.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I should think of Elsa as an enemy&#8230;? Err&#8230; L-Like, is this okay?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Suzuran&#8217;s leader adjusted her expression and stuck her chest out looking straight at her friend, who looked back at her in satisfaction&#8230; then stiffened her face.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">How to say it&#8230; You really grew&#8230;”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">What&#8230;?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Haha&#8230; To think that we had them alike once&#8230;”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Where are you looking at?! Where on earth are you looking at, Elsa?!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Mirta started to hit her while blushing, and the guard quivered under her friend&#8217;s assault while looking in front of her absent-mindedly. They were like sisters, so mixed feelings were probably raging within her right now.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Well, not like you&#8217;re any bad either. C&#8217;mon, stick &#8216;em out!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Hahaha&#8230; Takumi, you really need some lessons to understand how to deal with women&#8217;s delicate matters.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Isn&#8217;t it a bit too late to say that?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I should be the one to say that!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Then, Karin raised her hand lightly.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Thinking about it, Elsa, can I and Kunon also come at the buffet?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Mh? Yes, no problem. Guards and chaperones&#8217; attendants are also invited&#8230; how curious, though. I thought you hated those kinds of things.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Well, I do hate nobles, but my Master said he&#8217;d go, so I can&#8217;t not join him, don&#8217;t you think?”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">&#8230;Right. It will be reassuring to have my great secretary with me.”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The elf glimpsed at him, who nodded back at her quietly.\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">They finally had the chance to gather information, and Karin had the most useful ability for the occasion. She could read people&#8217;s mind by looking into their eyes, which meant that they could skip a lot of steps to obtain what they wanted.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Elsa didn&#8217;t know about that, so she nodded without much suspicion.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Anyway, feel free to come and bring Kunon too. Come to the Fairstadt residence on the appointed day, and I&#8217;ll bring you there myself.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">As she tried to stand up, she suddenly stopped.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">&#8230;Hey, wolf-girl. Get off. I have to go.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Nnnh&#8230; T&#8217;z monnin&#8217;~?”</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Kunon had fallen asleep while the others were talking and was now mumbling something incomprehensible.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Elsa enjoyed that scene before starting to slap her on her cheeks.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">C&#8217;mon, wake up. Sleeping right after eating is not good for your health.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Not sleepin&#8217; here&#8230; My food&#8217;s still there&#8230;”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">When her face started to get rubbed, she started to squirm restlessly.</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Ehehe&#8230; Pudding for dessert&#8230;”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Hey, don&#8217;t touch me there! No, stop drooling! Please, stop, for Filia&#8217;s sake! If you drench my coat it will be freezing cold outside! Nooo!”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Elsa tried to rip her off her lap, but looking at her innocent, sleeping face made her hesitate for an instant, and&#8230; the next moment, her coat was completely smeared with drool.\n</span></span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Everyone could see Elsa&#8217;s deep grief while she walked down the road in the chilly night with her coat in hand.</span></span></p>\n\n\n\n</p>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 21","slug":"newgame-chapter21","categories":[{"slug":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter21","category":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}}}
