Fml.\nI changed the following chapters to fix it: prologue 1, chapter 6, c.14, c.27, c.28, c.29, c.40. Now I seriously hope I fixed all my derpy old choices.\nOh, I decided to translate Mizuha's accent with cockney's (thank you Background Character for suggesting it). Hope she sounds enough cockney-ish.\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The tipsy fox and the demon form&#8217;s after-effects</h3>\n\n\nAs Mizuha emerged from the bathtub, I secured my towel around my waist.\nHow did I end up in this situation?\nShe was stark naked. If I had to compare her with Yuma—and I won&#8217;t specify what part I&#8217;m talking about—I&#8217;d say it was evident that she had been blessed with curves more generous than the youngest miracle children&#8217;s. If her most private parts weren&#8217;t hidden by her hair, I would&#8217;ve fled from there at full speed&#8230; but I was barely safe for now.\nI knew she enjoyed her coconobi shake, and I guessed she felt grateful since I asked her brother to join my guild, but waiting naked in the bathroom for a random guy she had just met was a little too much&#8230; and to make things worse, it looked like we were at least ten years apart.\nMaybe I was jumping to conclusions, but it felt like Mizuha had truly waited in there.\n“Aaah~! There are two Lord Dicks~! Oh, three! Struth! Oww, wot should I do~? Put the mockers on multiplyin&#8217;~!”\n“What? Wait, your face is kind of red&#8230; the water is barely lukewarm, how can you feel dizzy from it&#8230;?”\nThen, the answer flashed in my mind.\n“&#8230;Oh no. Did Zect let you taste his drink?”\n“Ehehe~! Sorry~! Me brother &#8216;as left the coconobi fruit behind&#8230; I thought it were a waste ter leave it there, so I took a bite from it and it were sooo good~!”\n“Y-You ate the coconobi&#8230;? The one soaked in rum?”\n“It tasted somewhat bitter at first, but then it were sooo sweet~! It&#8217;s been a long time since I last ate sumfink so tasty! Blimey!”\nRum&#8217;s abv, or ‘alcohol by volume’, is quite high. For example, it&#8217;s way easier to get drunk with rum than with beer given the latter&#8217;s low abv. An adult probably wouldn&#8217;t be affected by eating a coconobi fruit soaked in rum, but that isn&#8217;t the same for someone around Mizuha&#8217;s age.\n“&#8217;E &#8216;as left a bit o&#8217; &#8216;is drink too, so I finished it for &#8216;im~! I luv milk, but I might luv drinks more than that~! I &#8216;ope me brother leaves more for me next time~!”\n“Honestly, I don&#8217;t. Minors shouldn&#8217;t drink, so you&#8217;re forbidden from doing that.”\n“Okaaay~! Yer &#8216;ave a look somewhat like me brother, yer know~? I&#8217;m so glad ter spot this many brothers and sisters &#8216;round me, as well as Verlaine and yer&#8230;!”\nWait, what? No one&#8217;s around&#8230; oh, right, that&#8217;s just drunk gibberish.\nI could make her recover from her condition by touching her stomach&#8230; but what if she sobered up and accused me of laying my hands on her? It was better to let the alcohol run its course.\n“I like this bath! Blimey! I couldn&#8217;t &#8216;ave any wheh I stood before, neither I could enter many public ones&#8230; many blokes think it sucks ter enter a bath that&#8217;s been used by a demi-&#8216;uman&#8230;”\n“Is that so&#8230;? I heard that Lia used Timis&#8217; bath.”\n“Right? That tiger miss said I should&#8217;ve told &#8216;er if anyfink arsed me. Right&#8230; I&#8217;m lovin&#8217; this guild more and more~!”\n“This guild doesn&#8217;t discriminate demi-humans, and this will never change.”\n“Lord Dick&#8230;!”\nI wasn&#8217;t saying something particularly touching, but tears welled in her eyes as she looked at me deeply moved.\nShe was probably younger than Yuma&#8230; wait, maybe they were the same age. Even Yuma, who was four years younger than me, lately looked more like a lady, and Mizuha—despite looking a bit younger—was evidently growing too, so maybe&#8230;\nWait, what the hell was I thinking. I didn&#8217;t have time for this!\nZect had entrusted me his sister so he could go take the things they had left in Blue Sagittarius&#8217; dormitory, and I was indeed taking care of her in some way or another, although I didn&#8217;t want to end up in this situation&#8230; But a good Guild Master should play well their cards—I still had some way to escape from all of this.\n“Mi-Mizuha, I think you might want to dry yourself up and go to sleep before you catch a cold.”\n“I&#8217;m not cold~! &#8216;Ot baths make me feel dizzy, but I&#8217;m arright now~! This water&#8217;s warm and pleasant~! By the way, let me show yer me gratitude~!”\nShe then climbed on the bathtub&#8217;s edge, splashing water around. Now, that was dangerous and very careless of her, and I couldn&#8217;t tell if that unwise move had been dictated by the alcohol or by her need of showing me her gratitude.\nI mean, it wasn&#8217;t that far in the past that I had seen Beatrice, Aileen and the others naked, and Mizuha&#8217;s beauty wasn&#8217;t that far from theirs given the charm of her fox traits and her small frame, also&#8230;\nOkay, no. I really had to calm down.\nShe shook the water off her tail and ears, then she showed me a pearly smile.\nSuddenly, a thought flashed through my mind rivaling the speed of my eyes scanning her body: if her sense of shame was being dulled by alcohol, wouldn&#8217;t she going to feel horrible once she sobered up?\nI couldn&#8217;t ignore it.\n“Lord Dick, yer sure &#8216;ave a solid build~! Yer almost &#8216;ave a look more muscular than me brother~!”\n“W-Well&#8230; Guild Masters should be ready to face emergencies at all times.”\n“I spot~! If yer was stronger than Aileen, yer could &#8216;ave me dahn wiv a single flick on me &#8216;ead~!”\nI kept casting Support Magic on myself to keep my muscles trained despite being sitted all day at the bar. Zect&#8217;s body was very well built and I thought mine was less sturdy than his, but Mizuha&#8217;s ecstatic gaze made me guess she would&#8217;ve disagreed with me.\nShe wasn&#8217;t looking at me as she looked at her brother&#8230; and being stared from head to toe like that was unsettling in its own way.\nI had seen many girls becoming very straightforward when they were drunk, but that kind of temper was dangerous on many more levels when the involved parties shared the same bathroom—I was starting to feel nervous and somewhat filthy.\nAileen lent Mizuha one of her dresses because the demi-human&#8217;s only garment was her brother&#8217;s overcoat at first, but I would&#8217;ve never expected to see this girl in her birthday&#8217;s suit.\nI let this be a lesson—I had to be extra-careful when the girls slept here. Who knew how could they act.\n“Oh, right? Are yer thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; flickin&#8217; me &#8216;ead? Feel free ter give it a go if it&#8217;s only for once~!”\nShe got closer nonchalantly with a smile on her face, and her hair, until now covering her delicate parts, swayed along with her movements, failing to cover what they had to.\n“I, huh&#8230; I-It&#8217;s better if I don&#8217;t. Yeah, sorry, let me leave. Zect might get unhappy about this&#8230;”\n“Me brother still treats me like a child, but I&#8217;d like &#8216;im ter put the mockers on it&#8230; I&#8217;m plenty grown up right now. I&#8217;m bloody well not a child anymore.”\nShe mouthed those words with a sour expression on her flushed face.\nAlcohol probably contributed to her little burst of anger, but the very next moment she smiled to me so kindly I felt my strength melt away—her face was now bright, no shades of negativity tainting it.\n“Enough wiv that go on, it&#8217;s time ter show yer me gratitude~! I actually &#8216;ad a plan ter do this in some uvver way later, but well, right, yer shouldn&#8217;t &#8216;ave enter the bathroom wen I were in~!”\nI was really glad for her feelings and I felt like young demi-human girls quickly became affectionate to me&#8230; Riko did too. There must&#8217;ve been some reason behind it&#8230; maybe my smell?\n“Chuff~! Yor back&#8217;s so broad~! Even more than me favver&#8217;s~!”\n“Did you wash your father&#8217;s back? What a devoted daughter you are.”\n“&#8217;Uh, I didn&#8217;t. I seen it wen I were yornger, I were just recallin&#8217;&#8230; Me favver &#8216;as quite a big body compared ter the average &#8216;umans, and yet yer&#8230;”\nThe back of a man speaks for them, huh? That&#8217;s not very true, but Mizuha, after walking around me, stopped behind me and somewhat confirmed that figure of speech.\nShe looked interested in washing my back to show me her gratitude. This whole situation was a bit embarrassing, but if that was all she really wanted, there was no reason to panic.\nI untied my towel, paying attention not to show her anything, and sat on a bath stool. She then grabbed a soapy towel and started to rub my back so gently I thought she was trying to tickle me.\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eacQkur.png\" />\nAfter a little while, when I thought she was done and I could stand up, I froze in place.\nShe had now passed from my back to my arm, leaning on me—her hot body was pressing against mine, and I could distinctly feel something particularly soft rubbing my back.\n“Lord Dick, I can&#8217;t reach well yor arms from &#8216;ere&#8230; could yer raise them up for me?”\n“L-Like this&#8230;?”\nI did what she asked not to deepen the embarrassment of the situation, and the next moment, she rubbed my armpit. That&#8217;s when my body started to writhe due to the tickling.\nIt didn&#8217;t matter if I was a SSS rank adventurer who had defeated the previous Demon Lord: being tickled under the armpit was one of my weaknesses. There was nothing wrong with it. A man with insensible armpits is a mere golem.\n“Ugh! Mi-Mizuha, I think you did enough&#8230;”\n“I can&#8217;t put the mockers on it now, right, I still &#8216;ave ter wash the uvver side~! Amazin&#8217;, yor muscular even &#8216;ere&#8230;! Me arms are so puny compared ter yors&#8230;”\nHer comments made me feel like I owned Zect an apology. Enduring the tickling was a sort of torture, but I was sure my endurance had hit a level up, and it didn&#8217;t last long. Humans sure grow fast&#8230;\n“This should do~! Let me &#8216;ave some water ter wash it all away~! Mhhh&#8230; Oookay, Lord Dick~! Here I cooOHHH—”\n“Ugh—!”\nShe had slipped on the floor and my body moved on its own: to prevent her from falling and hitting her head, I flashed on my feet and held her in my arms.\n“I&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, my foot slipped&#8230;”\n“It&#8217;s fine. Are you hurt?”\n“N-Nuffink &#8216;urts, right, but&#8230; me chest feels sort of&#8230;”\n“&#8230;”\nMy hand was touching one of the soft things she had pushed on my back a few minutes before.\n“Lord Dick&#8230;”\nIt was the second time she had whispered my name with her sweet voice.\nI knew I should have left right after the first one.\nIt didn&#8217;t matter if I held her to prevent an accident: the moment she was in my arms, I had touched something I shouldn&#8217;t have, so I had to take responsibility for my actions.\nHer face flushed a bright red when she looked straight at me, her eyes wet again, her quivering lips slightly parted.\n“Chuff&#8230; I feel so dizzy&#8230;”\n“Mi-Mizuha?”\nHer body went limp.\nI guessed she gave in to drunkness and sleepiness the moment her brain registered that she had completed her task.\nNow I had to ask one of the girls to come dress her up and get her to sleep, but&#8230; how would I ask them?\nLike, if I were to tell them the truth—meaning that she got drunk because she ate the coconobi fruit her brother had left in his glass—and they didn&#8217;t trust me, it would make me look like a disgusting pig who seduced a young demi-human girl and took advantage of her in the bathroom.\n“Lord Dick&#8230; your back&#8217;s so&#8230; big&#8230;”\nAs I wondered how big she thought it was, I mustered my courage and lifted her while trying my best not to take advantage of her condition to look at her. I then carried Mizuha to the warm bathtub again, where I left her, and exited the bathroom without the slightest shade of guilt in me.\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">◆◇◆</p>\n\n\nMy head was filled with terrible outcomes as I walked to the livingroom praying any superior entity not to make things go as bad as I was picturing them.\n<em>Dick, what did you do to Mizuha?</em>\n<em>I would have never expected you to have such a sinful soul. I should lead it to Heaven once and for all.</em>\n<em>Disgusting. My trust was wasted on scum like you, Dick.</em>\n<em>Wow, so you&#8217;re like that&#8230; disappointing.</em>\n“Nh~! Yuma, your hands are so warm~!”\n“Aileen, stop moving&#8230; It will be over in a minute&#8230; amazing, this is so&#8230;!”\nThe chain of events I had pushed through that day etched in my mind that very moment—Aileen had stripped and was lying on the sofa while Yuma touched her belly.\nMy gods, that couldn&#8217;t be true—they couldn&#8217;t have gone that far already&#8230; but as I took a peep at them, I noticed that Aileen&#8217;s body was producing red magic power which looked tainted by some big and little black spots. It all flowed into Yuma and then returned into its owner without impurities.\nYuma was&#8230; probably purifying her soul.\nAileen&#8217;s demonic powers were the proof her soul was getting slowly consumed by the wrath it housed. However, thanks to Yuma&#8217;s soul-purifying abilities, she could keep it at bay.\n“&#8230;Thank you, I feel sooo much better now. Sorry for bothering you when you&#8217;re tired, Yuma.”\n“Do not worry, I will always help you. One of the missions in my life is to keep your soul clean at all times.”\n“Oww&#8230; that would make you my best friend. If it wasn&#8217;t for you, I might&#8217;ve already become a Demon Lord myself&#8230;”\nThat was the consequence of using her demonic power against Mizuha.\nAileen&#8217;s ‘standard’ adventurer score was around 95.000, which didn&#8217;t make her a real SSS rank adventurer, but it rose drastically when she used her demonic powers. To put it simply, her ability was like Mizuha&#8217;s: they both could turn into their ancestors&#8217; form and use their powers.\nThe demonic race was the strongest on the battlefield, and Aileen housed their prowess within herself. However, the demons&#8217; urge of destruction was so dreadful it consumed their owners&#8217;s soul, so using their power too much meant tearing oneself apart.\nOnce Yuma was done with treating Aileen, the demon put on her clothes again and patted her ‘nurse’ on the head. The younger girl accepted her gratitude with an embarrassed smile on her face.\n“&#8230;Aileen, sorry for having you use your powers. I didn&#8217;t think you needed to.”\n“Hey&#8230; d-don&#8217;t worry. I won&#8217;t become a monster as long as Yuma&#8217;s with me.”\n“Yes, there is no need to worry. I purified her soul&#8230; and&#8230; when it looks so pure, it reminds me&#8230; ahh&#8230; I would love to purify yours too, Dick&#8230;”\nYuma could see through everything—she could see the soul of people. There was no guilt within me, so it looked like she didn&#8217;t notice anything strange, but Aileen was staring at me in silence. The pressure of her gaze was slowly crushing me&#8230; was there a man who could withstand it in the world?\n“Dick, I don&#8217;t see Mizuha&#8230; don&#8217;t tell me you&#8230;”\n“N-No, let me explain. She has drunk some of her brother&#8217;s drink and she&#8217;s now a bit more than tipsy. Could you go help her?”\n“Right away, Master.”\n“I&#8217;m coming too&#8230; by the way, why are you all still awake in the dead of night?”\nMylarka and Verlaine had returned from the floor below just in time: the next moment, they were heading to the bathroom to take care of the matter while Mylarka searched for an answer to her question.\nThe genius girl often ended up drunk herself, so leaving Mizuha to them should&#8217;ve been fine.\n“Dick, you look quite tired. Should I quell your soul?”\n“Yuma, you know that ‘should I quell your soul’ gives off a funny vibe, right?”\n“Mh&#8230;? Quelling souls is wonderful for me&#8230; what kind of funny vibe does it give?”\n“Well&#8230; hahaha~! Nothing, I was just reading too much into it!”\nYuma was seriously puzzled and Aileen, who couldn&#8217;t bring herself to explain what she meant, just masked her comment with a smile.\nAileen was now looking a lot better. Maybe I should&#8217;ve asked Yuma to clean my impurities away&#8230; without letting her lead my soul to Heaven.\n\n</p>\n","title":"Guild Master &#8211; Chapter 45","slug":"guildmaster-chapter45","categories":[{"slug":"after-defeating-the-demon-lord-he-became-guild-master"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"guildmaster-chapter45","category":"after-defeating-the-demon-lord-he-became-guild-master"}}}
