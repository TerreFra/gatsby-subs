They also worked relentlessly</span><span lang=\"en-US\"> and when someone happened to stop, they were abandoned without problem.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">The children in that wagon didn’t have a future.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Aaah… Every time it’s the same story, but deep down I feel somewhat sorry.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Be quiet and stay alert, this time we have an elf. We only have to think about reaching Listina.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Beyond the cloth, the coachman, who was older judging by his voice, was talking to a young man.<br />\n</span>They were discussing about how they were going to sell the children to someone else, probably another slave merchant.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">By the way, they gave us a little extra since there were more goods, but… It’s not like we earned much for these brats.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Never refuse money. Also, even though they’re all skin and bone, sir Geiz will sell them all for sure.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Yeah… I remember Geiz. When he was paid for another deal, the box was too small for all the money.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">…Listen, why don’t you do your job instead of talking nonsense?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Okay! Look, this time I’ve made sure to prepare in advance. This box doesn’t have a key, so only a genius or Geiz himself could open it. Are you happy now?!”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">The young man showed a box to his </span><span lang=\"en-US\">collaborator, who clicked his tongue under the moonlight.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Hide it in the usual place, moron. You really need to shut up.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Eeh?! Why am I getting scolded?!”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Because you’re careless and always do whatever you want, like you just did with the key.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">But this way there’s no risk of losing it, isn’t it?!”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Their </span><span lang=\"en-US\">relaxed talk was the complete opposite compared to the way things were in the wagon.<br />\n</span>Takumi observed them from it in a calm manner.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">You really are weird.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">A voice reached him from below</span><span lang=\"en-US\"> and he turned his face toward it.<br />\n</span>The figures of Kunon and Karin were laying on the ground.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Karin, every time I try to talk to you, you ignore me. What, knowing that they’ll sell us suddenly makes you feel lonely?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">I ignore you because you always clown around.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Jeez… are you aware that the others keep their distance because of your manners?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Neither Lilia, Killfer nor any other child dared to approach them. Even now, Takumi was the only one brave enough to be near them.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Feel free to open your heart to me and have a talk to kill some time whenever you want.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">If I can gut you and sew your lips so that I can’t hear you talking with that obnoxious mouth of yours, count on it.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">I don’t want to make this wagon smell of blood. Also, where are you going to find needle and thread here? I think you should give up for now.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Tsk… What a shame. If not for these shackles, I could kill you in no time.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">What?! Takumi is nice! He gives me bread! You can’t kill him!”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Kunon spoke up with a warm and cheerful voice as she squirmed in her place.<br />\n<span lang=\"en-US\">She seemed to have taken a liking to him</span><span lang=\"en-US\">, perhaps because he gave her food every day.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">By the way, are elves stronger than humans?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Why do you ask?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">I thought that if you were, freeing yourself from those shackles would be a piece of cake.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">That depends from person to person. Between the demi-humans there are… the<br />\nwolf-men, like Kunon, who are strong and skilled at fighting, or the dragon-men who are covered by armored scales. It would be easy for them.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">What…? Kunon is a wolf? I thought she was a fox given the color of her fur.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Uff! I’m not a fox! I’m a wise and mighty wolf!”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">She said puffing her chest pridefully, but Takumi paid no attention to her extremely dumb pose.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Basically, you’re part of the wise wolves? I wonder… if you are strong even among your own kind, why you didn’t get rid of your shackles?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Because she would have done it if she could. Shackles for demi-humans are made of special metals, breaking them is not easy. If she were at full strength maybe she could do it, but… since the food is barely enough to keep us alive, it’s normal that she has no energy.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Yeah… Thanks to Takumi’s bread I feel a little better, but I’m still hungry and can’t use my full strength…”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Karin fell silent watching Kunon casting her gaze down dejectedly.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">What about the elves?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Of course, it’s impossible for us. Without our equipment we would be more useless than humans.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">I see… what kind of objects are you talking about?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">You really stick your nose everywhere… Taking bows, knives and various stones aside, which you can imagine yourself, magic is the real pride and strong point of elves. I’m talking about magic wands and magical objects.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">When she finished explaining,</span><span lang=\"en-US\"> she made eye contact with Takumi.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Just to be clear, I can’t use magic, so don’t expect anything from me.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Hey, don’t read my mind please.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">I thought I&#8217;d spare you a pointless question.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">You could’ve said that with an appropriate expression, at least.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">He sighed observing Karin fighting to keep the same expression.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">I hate doing pointless stuff, but talking with you wasn’t completely useless. Now I’m sure about the existence of magic and I understood that you were lying.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Oh, really? Tell me when I lied, then.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">She taunted him, but he didn’t look at her.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">I see. You taunt people to make eye contact, so you can ‘read their minds’… or something like that, right?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">The next </span><span lang=\"en-US\">moment, he clearly heard Karin holding her breath.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Wow, nice! No one understood it befoooh…”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Kunon, be a good girl and shut your mouth, please.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Karin glared at Takumi as she put her hands on the wolf-girl who started squirming.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">It’s too late now. I understood it the first time I gave you bread.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">He said yawing.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">You thought ‘look, that starving kid is offering us bread’. At first, you asked what my intentions were, so that you could guess them from my answer and expression. Still, you believed that I was going ask you something in return.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">That’s because I don’t believe in humans. It was obvious that you wanted something from us.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">In a situation like this it’s normal to doubt even children… But you’re not the only one who can read other’s mind, because magic isn’t necessary to do it.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Closing an eye, he tapped his temple with a finger.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Just like you didn’t lose my eyes for a moment, I kept watching yours. You never looked at my expressions or at my eyes’ movements. Still, you strongly believed that I would have asked something in return. Hence, I thought you must have used another way to find it.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Karin remained silent.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">I noticed a bunch of things talking with you… For example, you try not to talk if I don’t look at you in the eyes. Just like now.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">She sighed resigned.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Who on earth are you?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">I’ll tell you properly if we get the chance… but I need to confirm something. Let me talk to Kunon.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Reluctance painted her face, but she distanced her hands from her friend’s mouth.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Fuah~ Uuuh… I was choking…”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Karin is a disaster, isn’t she? Anyway Kunon, can you beat adults?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Well… I’m not sure about it, but I won’t lose as long as my legs can move!”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">She replied firmly lifting her beautiful legs. Takumi guessed that she wasn’t lying and </span><span lang=\"en-US\">that she was pretty confident in her own abilities.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Karin, what do you think about it? You two were together before ending up here, so no one should know her skills better than you.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">…As long as she can use her legs, she can win even against an armed foe, although she’s weakened. Werebeasts are generally fast and strong, so it’s necessary to bind their movements to keep them at bay. That’s why she has shackles at her ankles too.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hearing those words, Takumi tried to examine them. They really were tougher compared to wooden or steel shackles.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Fine. We can proceed, then.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">What are you up to?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">We made eye contact before, so you should know it, no?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">I meant… what do you need from us? I know you need something, but I don’t know what.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">She replied with a pouty look. She looked upset because Takumi found out about her power.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">There are many ways to get out of here. In the best-case scenario…”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">When he started to explain, the wagon stopped as the horses started to whine.<br />\nNearly at the same moment… angry male screams echoed along with the puzzled and afraid voices of the coachmen.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">No, we can’t fend off all of them! Let’s get out of…”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">The young man’</span><span lang=\"en-US\">s voice was interrupted and an irregular crimson stains appeared on the wagon’s cloth.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Serge! Hey, hang in there! No…! AAAHHH!!!”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-US\">After that agonizing scream ceased, rude </span><span lang=\"en-US\">laughs of men shook the air.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Takumi wanted to take a peek outside, but given the blood that was flowing within the wagon, guessing what had just happened wasn’t a hard task.<br />\nThe children were startled, and as they fell silent, Takumi turned to the two young girls.</p>\n<p lang=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-US\">Well… this is the worst.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">He said with a flat voice.</p>\n<hr />\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 2","slug":"newgame-chapter2","categories":[{"slug":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter2","category":"a-new-game-from-the-depths-of-captivity"}}}
